<p><i>Calais, June 21.</i>&mdash;What young lady, travelling for the first time
on the Continent, does not write a "Diary?" No sooner have we slept
on the shores of France&mdash;no sooner are we seated in the gay salon at
Dessin's, than we call, like Biddy Fudge, for "French pens and
French ink," and forth steps from its case the morocco-bound diary,
regularly ruled and paged, with its patent Bramah lock and key,
wherein we are to record and preserve all the striking, profound, and
original observations&mdash;the classical reminiscences&mdash;the thread-bare
raptures&mdash;the poetical effusions&mdash;in short, all the never-sufficiently-to-be-exhausted
topics of sentiment and enthusiasm, which must necessarily
suggest themselves while posting from Paris to Naples.</p>

<p>Verbiage, emptiness, and affectation!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;but what must I do, then, with my volume in green morocco?</p>

<p>Very true, I did not think of that.</p>

<p>We have all read the <span class="smcap">Diary of an Invalid</span>, the best of all diaries
since old Evelyn's.&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, then,&mdash;Here beginneth the <span class="smcap">Diary of a Blue Devil</span>.</p>

<p>What inconsistent beings are we!&mdash;How strange that in such a
moment as this, I can jest in mockery of myself! but I will write on.
Some keep a diary, because it is the fashion&mdash;a reason why <i>I</i> should
not; some because it is <i>blue</i>, but I am not <i>blue</i>, only a <i>blue devil</i>;
some for their amusement,&mdash;<i>amusement!!</i> alas! alas! and some
that they may remember,&mdash;and I that I may forget, O! would it were
possible.</p>

<p>When, to-day, for the first time in my life, I saw the shores of
England fade away in the distance&mdash;did the conviction that I should
never behold them more, bring with it one additional pang of regret,
or one consoling thought? neither the one nor the other. I leave behind
me the scenes, the objects, so long associated with pain; but
from pain itself I cannot fly: it has become a part of myself. I know
not yet whether I ought to rejoice and be thankful for this opportunity
of travelling, while my mind is thus torn and upset; or rather regret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
that I must visit scenes of interest, of splendour, of novelty&mdash;scenes
over which, years ago, I used to ponder with many a sigh, and many
a vain longing, now that I am lost to all the pleasure they could once
have excited: for what is all the world to me now?&mdash;But I will not
weakly yield: though time and I have not been long acquainted, do I
not know what miracles he, "the all-powerful healer," can perform?
Who knows but this dark cloud may pass away? Continual motion,
continual activity, continual novelty, the absolute necessity for self-command,
may do something for me. I cannot quite forget; but if I can
cease to remember for a few minutes, or even, it may be, for a few
hours? O how idle to talk of "<i>indulging</i> grief:" talk of indulging
the rack, the rheumatism! who ever indulged grief that truly felt it?
to <i>endure</i> is hard enough.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is o'er! with its pains and its pleasures,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The dream of affection is o'er!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feelings I lavish'd so fondly<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will never return to me more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With a faith, O! too blindly believing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A truth, no unkindness could move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My prodigal heart hath expended<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At once, an existence of love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, like the spendthrift forsaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By those whom his bounty had blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All empty, and cold, and despairing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It shrinks in my desolate breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But a spirit is burning within me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unquench'd, and unquenchable yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall teach me to bear uncomplaining,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The grief I can never forget.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Rouen, June 25.</i>&mdash;I do not pity Joan of Arc: that heroic woman
only paid the price which all must pay for celebrity in some shape or
other: the sword or the faggot, the scaffold or the field, public hatred
or private heart-break; what matter? The noble Bedford could not
rise above the age in which he lived: but <i>that</i> was the age of gallantry
and chivalry, as well as superstition: and could Charles, the
lover of Agnes Sorel, with all the knights and nobles of France, look
on while their champion, and a woman, was devoted to chains and
death, without one effort to save her?</p>

<p>It has often been said that her fate disgraced the military fame of
the English; it is a far fouler blot on the chivalry of France.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>St. Germains, June 27.</i>&mdash;I cannot bear this place, another hour in
it will kill me; this sultry evening&mdash;this sickening sunshine&mdash;this quiet,
unbroken, boundless landscape&mdash;these motionless woods&mdash;the Seine
stealing, creeping through the level plains&mdash;the dull grandeur of the old
chateau&mdash;the languid repose of the whole scene&mdash;instead of soothing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
torture me. I am left without resource, a prey to myself and to my
memory&mdash;to reflection, which embitters the source of suffering, and
thought, which brings distraction. Horses on to Paris! Vite! Vite!</p>

<p><i>Paris, 28.</i>&mdash;What said the witty Frenchwoman?&mdash;<i>Paris est le lieu
du monde o&ugrave; l'on peut le mieux se passer de bonheur;</i>&mdash;in that case it
will suit me admirably.</p>

<p><i>29.</i>&mdash;We walked and drove about all day: I was amused. I marvel
at my own versatility when I think how soon my quick spirits were
excited by this gay, gaudy, noisy, idle place. The different appearance
of the streets of London and Paris is the first thing to strike a
stranger. In the gayest and most crowded streets of London the people
move steadily and rapidly along, with a grave collected air, as if
all had some business in view; <i>here</i>, as a little girl observed the other
day, all the people walk about "like ladies and gentlemen going a visiting:"
the women well-dressed and smiling, and with a certain jaunty
air, trip along with their peculiar mincing step, and appear as if their
sole object was but to show themselves; the men ill-dressed, slovenly,
and in general ill-looking, lounge indolently, and stare as if they had
no other purpose in life but to look about them.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><i>July 12.</i>&mdash;"Quel est &agrave; Paris le supr&ecirc;me talent? celui d'amuser:
et quel est le supr&ecirc;me bonheur? l'amusement."</p>

<p>Then <i>le supr&ecirc;me bonheur</i> may be found every evening from nine to
ten, in a walk along the Boulevards, or a ramble through the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, and from ten to twelve in a salon at Tortoni's.</p>

<p>What an extraordinary scene was that I witnessed to-night! how
truly <i>French</i>! Spite of myself and all my melancholy musings, and
all my philosophic allowances for the difference of national character,
I was irresistibly compelled to smile at some of the farcical groups we
encountered. In the most crowded parts of the Champs Elys&eacute;es this
evening (Sunday), there sat an old lady with a wrinkled yellow face
and sharp features, dressed in flounced gown of dirty white muslin, a
pink sash and a Leghorn hat and feathers. In one hand she held a
small tray for the contribution of amateurs, and in the other an Italian
bravura, which she sung or rather screamed out with a thousand indescribable
shruggings, contortions, and grimaces, and in a voice to
which a cracked tea-kettle, or a "brazen candlestick turned," had
seemed the music of the spheres. A little farther on we found two
elderly gentlemen playing at see-saw; one an immense corpulent man
of fifteen stone at least, the other a thin dwarfish animal with gray
mustachios, who held before him what I thought was a child, but on
approaching, it proved to be a large stone strapped before him, to
render his weight a counterpoise to that of his huge companion. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
passed on, and returning about half an hour afterwards down the same
walk, we found the same venerable pair pursuing their edifying
amusement with as much enthusiasm as before.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Before the revolution, sacrilege became one of the most frequent
crimes. I was told of a man who, having stolen from a church the
silver box containing the consecrated wafers, returned the wafers next
day in a letter to the Cur&eacute; of the Parish, <i>having used one of them to
seal his envelop</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>July 27.</i>&mdash;A conversation with S** always leaves me sad. Can it
then be possible that he is right? No&mdash;O no! my understanding rejects
the idea with indignation, my whole heart recoils from it; yet if
it should be so! what then: have I been till now the dupe and the
victim of factitious feelings? virtue, honour, feeling, generosity, you
are then but words, signifying nothing? Yet if this vain philosophy
lead to happiness, would not S** be happy? it is evident he is <i>not</i>.
When he said that the object existed not in this world which could lead
him twenty yards out of his way, did this sound like happiness? I remember
that while he spoke, instead of feeling either persuaded or
convinced by his captivating eloquence, I was perplexed and distressed;
I <i>suffered</i> a painful compassion, and tears were in my eyes. I, who
so often have pitied myself, pitied him at that moment a thousand times
more; I thought, I would not buy tranquillity at such a price as he has
paid for it. Yet <i>if</i> he should be right? that <i>if</i>, which every now and
then suggests itself, is terrible; it shakes me in the utmost recesses of
my heart.</p>

<p>S**, in spite of myself, and in spite of all that with most perverted
pains he has made himself (so different from what he once was), can
charm and interest, pain and perplex me:&mdash;not so D**, another
disciple of the same school: he inspires me with the strongest antipathy
I ever felt for a human being. Insignificant and disagreeable
is his appearance, he looks as if all the bile under heaven had found
its way into his complexion, and all the infernal irony of a Mephistopheles
into his turned-up nose and insolent curled lip. He is, he
<i>says</i> he is, an atheist, a materialist, a sensualist: the pains he takes
to deprave and degrade his nature, render him so disgusting, that I
could not even speak in his presence; I dreaded lest he should enter
into conversation with me. I might have spared myself the fear.
He piques himself on his utter contempt for, and disregard of, women;
and, after all, is not himself worthy these words I bestow on him.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Aug. 25.</i>&mdash;Here begins, I hope, a new &aelig;ra. I have had a long
and dangerous illness; the crisis perhaps of what I have been suffering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
for months. Contrary to my own wishes, and to the expectations of
others, I <i>live</i>: and trusting in God that I have been preserved for
some wise and good purpose, am therefore thankful: even supposing
I should be reserved for new trials, I cannot surely in this world
suffer more than I have suffered: it is not possible that the same
causes can be again combined to afflict me.</p>

<p>How truly can I say, few and evil have my days been! may I not
say as truly, I have not weakly yielded, I have not "gone about to
cause my heart to despair," but have striven, and not in vain? I took
the remedies they gave me, and was grateful; I resigned myself to
<i>live</i>, when had I but willed it, I might have died; and when to die
and be at rest, seemed to my sick heart the only covetable boon.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 3.</i>&mdash;A terrible anniversary at Paris&mdash;still ill and very weak.
Edmonde came, <i>pour me d&eacute;sennuyer</i>. He has soul enough to bear a
good deal of wearing down; but whether the fine qualities he possesses
will turn to good or evil, is hard to tell: it is evident his character
has not yet settled: it vibrates still as nature inclines him to good,
and all the circumstances around him to evil. We talked as usual of
women, of gallantry, of the French and English character, of national
prejudices, of Shakspeare and Racine (never failing subjects of discussion),
and he read aloud Delille's Catacombes de Rome, with great
feeling, animation, and dramatic effect.</p>

<p><i>La mode</i> at Paris is a spell of wondrous power: it is most like what
we should call in England a rage, a mania, a torrent sweeping down
the bounds between good and evil, sense and nonsense, upon whose
surface straws and egg-shells float into notoriety, while the gold and
the marble are buried and hidden till its force be spent. The rage
for cashmeres and little dogs has lately given way to a rage for Le
Solitaire, a romance written, I believe, by a certain Vicomte d'Arlincourt.
Le Solitaire rules the imagination, the taste, the dress of half
Paris: if you go to the theatre, it is to see the "Solitaire," either as
tragedy, opera, or melodrame; the men dress their hair and throw
their cloaks about them <i>&agrave; la Solitaire</i>; bonnets and caps, flounces
and ribbons, are all <i>&agrave; la Solitaire</i>; the print shops are full of scenes
from Le Solitaire; it is on every toilette, on every work-table;&mdash;ladies
carry it about in their reticules to show each other that they are
<i>&agrave; la mode</i>; and the men&mdash;what can they do but humble their understandings
and be <i>extasi&eacute;s</i>, when beautiful eyes sparkle in its defence
and glisten in its praise, and ruby lips pronounce it divine, delicious;
"quelle sublimit&eacute; dans les descriptions, quelle force dans les caract&egrave;res!
quelle &acirc;me! feu! chaleur! verve! originalit&eacute;! passion!" etc.</p>

<p>"Vous n'avez pas lu le Solitaire?" said Madame M. yesterday.
"Eh mon dieu! il est donc possible! vous? mais, ma ch&egrave;re, vous
&ecirc;tes perdue de r&eacute;putation, et pour jamais!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>To retrieve my lost reputation, I sat down to read Le Solitaire,
and as I read my amazement grew, and I did in "gaping wonderment
abound," to think that fashion, like the insane root of old, had power
to drive a whole city mad with nonsense; for such a tissue of abominable
absurdities, bombast and blasphemy, bad taste and bad language,
was never surely indited by any madman, in or out of Bedlam: not
Maturin himself, that king of fustian,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;ever wrote or borrowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any thing half so horrid!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and this is the book which has turned the brains of half Paris, which
has gone through fifteen editions in a few weeks, which not to admire
is "<i>pitoyable</i>," and not to have read "<i>quelque chose d'inouie</i>."</p>

<p>The objects at Paris which have most struck me, have been those
least vaunted.</p>

<p>The view of the city from the Pont des Arts, to-night, enchanted
me. As every body who goes to Rome views the Coliseum by moonlight,
so nobody should leave Paris without seeing the effect from the
Pont des Arts, on a fine moonlight night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Earth hath not any thing to show more fair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is singular I should have felt its influence at such a moment: it
appears to me that those who, from feeling too strongly, have learnt
to consider too deeply, become less sensible to the works of art, and
more alive to nature. Are there not times when we turn with indifference
from the finest picture or statue&mdash;the most improving book&mdash;the
most amusing poem; and when the very commonest, and every-day
beauties of nature, a soft evening, a lovely landscape, the moon
riding in her glory through a clouded sky, without forcing or asking
attention, sink into our hearts? They do not console,&mdash;they sometimes
add poignancy to pain; but still they have a power, and do not
speak in vain: they become a part of us; and never are we so inclined
to claim kindred with nature, as when sorrow has lent us her
mournful experience. At the time I felt this (and how many have
felt it as deeply, and expressed it better!) I did not <i>think</i> it, still
less could I have <i>said it</i>; but I have pleasure in recording the past
impression. "On rend mieux compte de ce qu'on a senti que de ce
qu'on sent."</p>

<p><i>September 8.</i>&mdash;Paris is crowded with English; and I do not wonder
at it; it is, on the whole, a pleasant place to live in. I like Paris,
though I shall quit it without regret as soon as I have strength to
travel. Here the social arts are carried to perfection&mdash;above all, the
art of conversation: every one talks much and talks well. In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
multiplicity of words it must happen of course that a certain quantum
of ideas is intermixed: and somehow or other, by dint of listening,
talking, and looking about them, people <i>do</i> learn, and information to a
certain point is general. Those who have knowledge are not shy of
imparting it, and those who are ignorant take care not to seem so; but
are sometimes agreeable, often amusing, and seldom <i>b&ecirc;tes</i>. Nowhere
have I seen unformed sheepish boys, nowhere the surliness, awkwardness,
ungraciousness, and uneasy proud bashfulness, I have seen in
the best companies in England. Our French friend Lucien has, at
fifteen, the air and conversation of a finished gentleman; and our
English friend C&mdash;&mdash; is at eighteen, the veriest log of a lumpish
school-boy that ever entered a room. What I have seen of society,
I like: the delicious climate too, the rich skies, the clear elastic atmosphere,
the <i>out of doors</i> life the people lead, are all (in summer at
least) delightful. There may be less <i>comfort</i> here; but nobody feels
the want of it; and there is certainly more amusement&mdash;and amusement
is here truly "le supr&ecirc;me bonheur." Happiness, according to
the French meaning of the word, lies more on the surface of life: it is
a sort of happiness which is cheap and ever at hand. This is the
place to live in for the merry poor man, or the melancholy rich one:
for those who have too much money, and those who have too little;
for those who only wish, like the Irishman "to live all the days of
their life,"&mdash;<i>prendre en l&eacute;g&egrave;re monnaie la somme des plaisirs</i>: but
to the thinking, the feeling, the domestic man, who only exists, enjoys,
suffers through his affections&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who is retired as noontide dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fountain in a noonday grove&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to such a one, Paris must be nothing better than a vast frippery
shop, an ever-varying galantee show, an eternal vanity fair, a vortex
of folly, a pandemonium of vice.</p>

<p><i>September 18.</i>&mdash;Our imperials are packed, our passports signed, and
we set off to-morrow for Geneva by Dijon and the Jura. I leave nothing
behind me to regret, I see nothing before me to fear, and have
no hope but in change; and now all that remains to be said of Paris,
and all its wonders and all its vanities, all its glories and all its gaieties,
are they not recorded in the ponderous chronicles of most veracious
tourists, and what can I add thereto?</p>

<p><i>Geneva, Saturday Night, 11 <a name="oclock" id="oclock"></a>o'clock.</i>&mdash;Can it be the "blue rushing
of the arrowy Rhone" I hear from my window? Shall I hear it to-morrow,
when I wake? Have I seen, have I felt the reality of what
I have so often imagined? and much, <i>much</i> more? How little do I
feel the contretemps and privations which affect others&mdash;and feel them
<i>only</i> because they affect others! To me they are nothing: I have in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a few hours stored my mind with images of beauty and grandeur which
will last through my whole existence.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Yet I know I am not singular; others have felt the same: others,
who, capable of "drinking in the soul of things," have viewed nature
less with their eyes than their hearts. Now I feel the value of my own
enthusiasm; now am I repaid in part for many pains and sorrows and
errors it has cost me. Though the natural expression of that enthusiasm
be now repressed and restrained, and my spirits subdued by long
illness, what but enthusiasm could elevate my mind to a level with the
sublime objects round me, and excite me to pour out my whole heart
in admiration as I do now! How deeply they have penetrated into my
imagination!&mdash;Beautiful nature! If I could but infuse into you a
portion of my own existence as you have become a part of mine&mdash;If I
could but bid you reflect back my soul, as it reflects back all your magnificence,
I would make you my only friend, and wish no other; content
"to love earth only for its earthly sake."</p>

<p>I am so tired to-night, I can say nothing of the Jura, nor of the superb
ascent of the mountain, to me so novel, so astonishing a scene;
nor of the cheerful brilliance of the morning sun, illuminating the
high cliffs, and throwing the deep woody vallies into the darkest shadow;
nor of the far distant plains of France seen between the hills,
and melting away into a soft vapoury light; nor of Morey, and its delicious
strawberries and honey-comb; nor of that never-to-be-forgotten
moment, when turning the corner of the road, as it wound round a
cliff near the summit, we beheld the lake and city of Geneva spread at
our feet, with its magnificent back-ground of the Italian Alps, peak beyond
peak, snow-crowned! and Mont Blanc towering over all! No
description had prepared me for this prospect; and the first impression
was rapturous surprise; but by degrees the vastness and the huge gigantic
features of the scene pressed like a weight upon "my amazed
sprite," and the feeling of its immense extent fatigued my imagination
till my spirits gave way in tears. Then came remembrances of those
I ought to forget, blending with all I saw a deeper power&mdash;raising up
emotions, long buried though not dead, to fright me with their resurrection.
I was so glad to arrive here, and shall be <i>so</i> glad to sleep&mdash;even
the dull sleep which laudanum brings me.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 1.</i>&mdash;When next I submit (having the power to avoid it) to be
crammed into a carriage and carried from place to place, whether I
would or not, and be set down at the stated <i>points de vue</i>, while a
detestable laquais points out what I am to admire, I shall deserve to
endure again what I endured to-day. As there was no possibility of
relief, I resigned myself to my fate, and was even amused by the absurdity
of my own situation. We went to see the junction of the Arve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and the Rhone: or rather to see the Arve pollute the rich, blue transparent
Rhone, with its turbid waters. The day was heavy, and the
clouds rolled in prodigious masses along the dark sides of the mountains,
frequently hiding them from our view, and substituting for their
graceful outlines and ever-varying contrast of tint and shade, an impenetrable
veil of dark gray vapour.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;We took a boat and rowed on the lake for about two hours.
Our boatman, a fine handsome athletic figure, was very talkative and
intelligent. He had been in the service of Lord Byron, and was with
him in that storm between La Meillerie and St. Gingough, which is
described in the third canto of Childe Harold. He pointed out among
the beautiful villas, which adorn the banks on either side, that in which
the empress Josephine had resided for six months, not long before her
death. When he spoke of her, he rested upon his oars to descant upon
her virtues, her generosity, her affability, her goodness to the poor, and
his countenance became quite animated with enthusiasm. Here, in
France, wherever the name of Josephine is mentioned, there seems to
exist but one feeling, one opinion of her beneficence and <i>amabilit&eacute;</i> of
character. Our boatman had also rowed Marie Louise across the lake,
on her way to Paris: he gave us no very captivating picture of her.
He described her as "<i>grande, blonde, bien faite et extr&ecirc;mement fi&egrave;re</i>:"
and told us how she tormented her ladies in waiting; "<i>comme elle
tracassait ses dames d'honneur</i>." The day being rainy and gloomy,
her attendants begged of her to defer the passage for a short time, till
the fogs had cleared away, and discovered all the beauty of the surrounding
shores. She replied haughtily and angrily, "Je veux faire
ce que je veux&mdash;allez toujours."</p>

<p>M. le Baron M&mdash;&mdash;n, whom we knew at Paris, told me several delightful
anecdotes of Josephine: he was attached to her household, and
high in her confidence. Napoleon sent him on the very morning of
his second nuptials, with a message and billet to the ex-empress. On
hearing that the ceremony was performed which had passed her sceptre
into the hands of the proud, cold-hearted Austrian, the feelings of the
<i>woman</i> overcame every other. She burst into tears, and wringing her
hands, exclaimed "Ah! au moins, qu'il soit heureux!" Napoleon
resigned this estimable and amiable creature to narrow views of selfish
policy, and with her his good genius fled: he deserved it, and verily he
hath had his reward.</p>

<p>We drove after dinner to Copet; and the Duchesse de Broglie being
absent, had an opportunity of seeing the chateau. All things "were
there of her"&mdash;of her, whose genuine worth excused, whose all-commanding
talents threw into shade, those failings which belonged to the
weakness of her sex, and her warm feelings and imagination. The
servant girl who showed us the apartments, had been fifteen years in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Madame de Sta&euml;l's service. All the servants had remained long in the
family, "elle &eacute;tait si bonne et si charmante ma&icirc;tresse!" A picture of
Madame de Sta&euml;l when young, gave me the idea of a fine countenance
and figure, though the features were irregular. In the bust, the expression
is not so prepossessing:&mdash;<i>there</i> the colour and brilliance of her
splendid dark eyes, the finest feature of her face, are of course quite
lost. The bust of M. Rocca<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> was standing in the Baron de Sta&euml;l's
dressing-room: I was more struck with it than any thing I saw, not
only as a chef-d'&#339;uvre, but from the perfect and regular beauty of
the head, and the charm of the expression. It was just such a mouth as
we might suppose to have uttered his well-known reply&mdash;"<i>Je l'aimerai
tellement qu'elle finira par m'aimer.</i>" Madame de Sta&euml;l had a son
by this marriage, who had just been brought home by his brother, the
Baron, from a school in the neighbourhood. He is about seven years
old. If we may believe the servant, Madame de Sta&euml;l did not acknowledge
this son till just before her death; and she described the
wonder of the boy on being brought home to the chateau, and desired
to call <i>Monsieur le Baron</i> "Mon fr&egrave;re" and "Auguste." This part
of Madame de Sta&euml;l's conduct seems incomprehensible; but her death
is recent, the circumstances little known, and it is difficult to judge her
motives. As a <i>woman</i>, as a <i>wife</i>, she might not have been able to
brave "the world's dread laugh"&mdash;but as a <i>mother</i>?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We have also seen Ferney&mdash;a place which did not interest me much,
for I have no sympathies with Voltaire:&mdash;and some other beautiful
scenes in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The Panorama exhibited in London just before I left it, is wonderfully
correct, with one pardonable exception: the artist did not venture
to make the waters of the lake of the intense ultramarine tinged with
violet as I now see them before me;</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Quitted Geneva, and slept at St. Maurice. I was ill
during the last few days of our stay, and therefore left Geneva with the
less regret. I suffer now so constantly, that a day tolerably free from
pain seems a blessing for which I can scarce be sufficiently thankful.
Such was yesterday.</p>

<p>Our road lay along the south bank of the lake, through Evian, Thonon,
St. Gingough: and on the opposite shores we had in view successively,
Lausanne, Vevai, Clarens, and Chillon. A rain storm pursued, or
almost surrounded us the whole morning; but we had the good fortune
to escape it. We travelled faster than it could pursue, and it seemed
to retire before us as we approached. The effect was surprisingly
beautiful; for while the two extremities of the lake were discoloured
and enveloped in gloom, that part opposite to us was as blue and transparent
as heaven itself, and almost as bright. Over Vevai, as we
viewed it from La Meillerie, rested one end of a glorious rainbow: the
other extremity appeared to touch the bosom of the lake, and shone
vividly against the dark mountains above Chillon. La Meillerie&mdash;Vevai!
what magic in those names! and O what a power has genius
to hallow with its lovely creations, scenes already so lavishly adorned
by Nature! it was not, however, of St. Preux I thought, as I passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
under the rock of the Meillerie. Ah! how much of happiness, of enjoyment,
have I lost, in being forced to struggle against my feelings,
instead of abandoning myself to them! but surely I have done right.
Let me repeat it again and again to myself, and let that thought, if
possible, strengthen and console me.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I have resolved to attempt no description of scenery; but
my pen is fascinated. I <i>must</i> note a few of the objects which struck
me to-day and yesterday, that I may at will combine them hereafter
to my mind's eye, and recall the glorious pictures I beheld, as we travelled
through the Vallais to Brig: the swollen and turbid (no longer
"blue and arrowy") Rhone, rushing and roaring along; the gigantic
mountains in all their endless variety of fantastic forms, which enclosed
us round,&mdash;their summits now robed in curling clouds, and then, as
the winds swept them aside, glittering in the sunshine; the little villages
perched like eagles' nests on the cliffs, far, far above our heads;
the deep rocky channels through which the torrents had madly broken
a way, tearing through every obstacle till they reached the Rhone, and
marking their course with devastation; the scene of direful ruin at
Martigny; the cataracts gushing, bounding from the living rock and
plunging into some unseen abyss below; even the shrubs and the fruit
trees which in the wider parts of the valley bordered the road side;
the vines, the rich scarlet barberries, the apples and pears which we
might have gathered by extending our hands;&mdash;all and each, when I
recall them, will rise up a vivid picture before my own fancy;&mdash;but
never could be truly represented to the mind of another&mdash;at least
through the medium of words.</p>

<p>And yet, with all its wonders and beauties, this day's journey has
not enchanted me like Saturday's. The scenery <i>then</i> had a different
species of beauty, a deeper interest&mdash;when the dark blue sky was
above our heads, and the transparent lake shone another heaven at our
feet, and the recollection of great and glorious names, and visions of
poetic fancy, and ideal forms more lovely than ever trod this earth,
hovered around us:&mdash;and then those thoughts which would intrude&mdash;remembrances
of the far-off absent, who are or have been loved, mingled
with the whole, and shed an imaginary splendour or a tender interest,
over scenes which required no extraneous powers to enhance
their native loveliness.&mdash;no charm borrowed from imagination to embellish
the all-beautiful reality.</p>

<p><i>Duomo d'Ossola.</i>&mdash;What shall I say of the marvellous, the miraculous
Simplon? Nothing: every body has said already every thing
that <i>can</i> be said and <i>exclaimed</i>.</p>

<p>In our descent, as the valley widened, and the stern terrific features
of the scene assumed a gentler character, we came to the beautiful
village of Davedro, with its cottages and vineyards spread over a green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
slope, between the mountains and the torrent below. This lovely
nook struck me the more from its contrast with the region of snows,
clouds, and barren rocks to which our eyes had been for several hours
accustomed. In such a spot as Davedro I fancied I should wish to
<i>live</i>, could I in life assemble round me all that my craving heart and
boundless spirit desire;&mdash;<i>or die</i>, when life had exhausted all excitement,
and the subdued and weary soul had learned to be content with
repose:&mdash;but not not till <i>then</i>.</p>

<p>We are now in Italy; but have not yet heard the soft sounds of the
Italian language. However, we read with great satisfaction the Italian
denomination of our Inn, "La grande Alberga della Villa"&mdash;called
out "Cameriere!" instead of "Gar&ccedil;on!"&mdash;plucked ripe grapes
as they hung from the treillages above our heads&mdash;gathered green figs
from the trees, bursting and luscious&mdash;panted with the intense heat&mdash;intense
and overpowering from its contrast with the cold of the Alpine
regions we had just left&mdash;and fancied we began to feel</p>

<p><i>11 at night.</i>&mdash;Fatigue and excitement have lately proved too much
for me: but I will not sink. I will yet bear up; and when a day thus
passed amid scenes like those of a romance, amid all that would once
have charmed my imagination, and enchanted my senses, brings no real
pleasure, but is ended, as <i>now</i> it ends, in tears, in bitterness of heart,
in languor, in sickness, and in pain&mdash;ah! let me remember the lesson
of resignation I have lately learned; and by elevating my thoughts to
a better world, turn to look upon the miserable affections which have
agitated me <i>here</i> as&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Could I but become as insensible, as regardless of the painful past
as I am of the all lovely present! Why was I proud of my victory
over passion? alas! what avails it that I have shaken the viper from
my hand, if I have no miraculous antidote against the venom which
has mingled with my life-blood, and clogged the pulses of my heart!
But the antidote of Paul&mdash;even faith&mdash;may it not be mine if I duly
seek it?</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Arona, on the banks of the Lago Maggiore.</i>&mdash;Rousseau mentions
somewhere, that it was once his intention to place the scene of the
Helo&iuml;se in the Borromean Islands. What a French idea! How
strangely incongruous had the pastoral simplicity of his lovers appeared
in such a scene! It must have changed, if not the whole plan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
at least the whole colouring of the tale. Imagine <i>la divine</i> <span class="smcap">Julie</span> tripping
up and down the artificial terraces of the Isola Bella, among
flower pots and statues, and colonnades and grottos; and St. Preux
sighing towards her, from some trim fantastic wilderness in the Isola
Madre!</p>

<p>The day was heavenly, and I shall never forget the sunset, as we
viewed it reflected in the lake, which appeared at one moment an expanse
of living fire. This is the first we have seen of those effulgent
sunsets with which Italy will make us familiar.</p>

<p><i>Milan.</i>&mdash;Our journey yesterday, through the flat fertile plains of
Lombardy, was not very interesting; and the want of novelty and
excitement made it fatiguing, in spite of the matchless roads and the
celerity with which we travelled.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think of Napoleon in England, it is impossible
to travel on the Continent, and more particularly through Lombardy,
without being struck with the magnificence and vastness of his public
works&mdash;either designed or executed. He is more regretted here than
in France; or rather he has not been so soon banished from men's
minds. In Italy he followed the rational policy of depressing the
nobles, and providing occupation and amusement for the lower classes.
I spoke to-day with an intelligent artisan, who pointed out to us a
hall built near the public walk by Napoleon, for the people to dance
and assemble in, when the weather was unfavourable. The man concluded
some very animated and sensible remarks on the late events,
by adding expressively, that though many had been benefited by the
change, there was to him and all others of his class as much difference
between the late reign and the present, as between <i>l'or et le fer</i>.</p>

<p>The silver shrine of St. Carlo Borromeo, with all its dazzling waste
of magnificence, struck me with a feeling of melancholy and indignation.
The gems and gold which lend such a horrible splendour to
corruption; the skeleton head, grinning ghastly under its invaluable
coronet; the skeleton hand supporting a crozier glittering with diamonds,
appeared so frightful, so senseless a mockery of the excellent,
simple-minded, and benevolent being they were intended to honour,
that I could but wonder, and escape from the sight as quickly as possible.
The Duomo is on the whole more remarkable for the splendour
of the material, than the good taste with which it is employed: the
statues which adorn it inside and out, are sufficient of themselves to
form a very respectable congregation: they are four thousand in
number.</p>

<p><i>9th, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;We gave the morning to the churches, and the
evening to the Ambrosian library. The day was, on the whole, more
fatiguing than edifying or amusing. I remarked whatever was remarkable,
admired all that is usually admired, but brought away few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
impressions of novelty or pleasure. The objects which principally
struck my capricious and fastidious fancy, were precisely
those which passed unnoticed by every one else, and are not worth
recording. In the first church we visited, I saw a young girl respectably
and even elegantly dressed, in the beautiful costume of the Milanese,
who was kneeling on the pavement before a crucifix, weeping bitterly,
and at the same time fanning herself most vehemently with a large
green fan. Another church (St. Alessandro, I think) was oddly decorated
for a Christian temple. A statue of Venus stood on one side
of the porch, a statue of Hercules on the other. The two divinities,
whose attributes could not be mistaken, had been <i>converted</i> from heathenism
into two very respectable saints. I forget their <i>christian
names</i>. Nor is this the most amusing metamorphosis I have seen
here. The transformation of two heathen divinities into saints, is
matched by the apotheosis of two modern sovereigns into pagan deities.
On the frieze of the <i>salle</i>, adjoining the amphitheatre, there is
a head of Napoleon, which, by the addition of a beard, has been converted
into a Jupiter; and on the opposite side, a head of Josephine,
which, being already beautiful and dignified, has required no alteration,
except in name, to become a creditable Minerva.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;At the Brera, now called the "Palace of the Arts and
Sciences," we spent some delightful hours. There is a numerous
collection of pictures by Titian, Guido, Albano, Schidone, the three
Carraccis, Tintoretto, Giorgione, etc. Some old paintings in fresco,
by Luini and others of his age, were especially pointed out to us, which
had been cut from the walls of churches now destroyed. They are
preserved here, I presume, as curiosities, and specimens of the progress
of the arts, for they possess no other merit&mdash;none, at least, that
I could discover. Here is the "Marriage of the Virgin," by Raffaelle,
of which I had often heard. It disappointed me at the first glance,
but charmed me at the second, and enchanted me at the third. The
unobtrusive grace and simplicity of Raffaelle do not immediately
strike an eye so unpractised, and a taste so unformed as mine still is:
for though I have seen the best pictures in England, we have there
no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the two divinest masters
of the Italian art, Raffaelle and Correggio. There are not, I conceive,
half a dozen of either in all the collections together, and those we do possess,
are far from being among their best efforts. But Raffaelle must not
make me forget the Hagar in the Brera: the affecting&mdash;the inimitable
Hagar! what agony, what upbraiding, what love, what helpless desolation
of heart in that countenance! I may well remember the deep
pathos of this picture; for the face of Hagar has haunted me sleeping
and waking ever since I beheld it. Marvellous power of art! that
mere inanimate forms, and colours compounded of gross materials,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
should thus live&mdash;thus speak&mdash;thus stand a soul-felt presence before
us, and from the senseless board or canvas, breathe into our hearts a
feeling, beyond what the most impassioned eloquence could ever inspire&mdash;beyond
what mere words can ever render.</p>

<p>Last night and the preceding we spent at the Scala. The opera was
stupid, and Madame Bellochi, who is the present primadonna, appeared
to me harsh and ungraceful, when compared to Fodor. The new ballet
however, amply indemnified us for the disappointment. Our Italian
friends condoled with us on being a few days too late to see <i>La Vestale</i>,
which had been performed for sixty nights, and is one of Vigano's
masterpieces. I thought the <i>Didone Abbandonata</i> left us nothing to
regret. The immense size of the stage, the splendid scenery, the
classical propriety and magnificence of the dresses, the fine music,
and the exquisite acting (for there is very little dancing), all conspired
to render it enchanting. The celebrated cavern scene in the fourth
book of Virgil, is rather too closely copied in a most inimitable pas
de deux; so closely, indeed, that I was considerably alarmed <i>pour les
biens&eacute;ances</i>; but little Ascanius, who is asleep in a corner (Heaven
knows how he came there), wakes at the critical moment, and the
impending catastrophe is averted. Such a scene, however beautiful,
would not, I think, be endured on the English stage. I observed that
when it began, the curtains in front of the boxes were withdrawn, the
whole audience, who seemed to be expecting it, was hushed; the
deepest silence, the most delighted attention prevailed during its performance;
and the moment it was over, a third of the spectators departed.
I am told this is always the case; and that in almost every
ballet d'action, the public are gratified by a scene, or scenes, of a similar
tendency.</p>

<p>The second time I saw the <i>Didone</i>, my attention, in spite of the
fascination of the scene, was attracted towards a box near us, which
was occupied by a noble English family just arrived at Milan. In
the front of the box sat a beautiful girl apparently not fifteen, with
laughing lips and dimpled cheeks, the very personification of blooming,
innocent, <i>English</i> loveliness. I watched her (I could not help it, when
my interest was once awakened) through the whole scene. I marked
her increased agitation: I saw her cheeks flush, her eyes glisten, her
bosom flutter, as if with sighs I could not overhear, till at length, overpowered
with emotion, she turned away her head, and covered her
eyes with her hand. Mothers!&mdash;English mothers! who bring your
daughters abroad to finish their education&mdash;do you well to expose them
to scenes like these, and <i>force</i> the young bud of early feeling in such a
precious hot-bed as this? Can a finer finger on the piano,&mdash;a finer taste
in painting, or any possible improvement in foreign arts and foreign
graces, compensate for one taint on that moral purity, which has ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
been (and may it ever be!) the boast, the charm of Englishwomen?
But what have I to do with all this?&mdash;I came here to be amused and
to forget;&mdash;not to moralize or to criticise.</p>

<p>Vigano, who is lately dead, composed the <i>Didone Abbandonata</i> as
well as <i>La Vestale</i>, Otello, Nina, and others. All his ballets are celebrated
for their classical beauty and interest. This man, though but a
dancing-master, must have had the soul of a painter, a musician, and
a poet in one. He must have been a perfect master of design, grouping,
contrast, picturesque, and scenic effect. He must have had the
most exquisite feeling for musical expression, to adapt it so admirably
to his purposes; and those gestures and movements with which he has
so gracefully combined it, and which address themselves but too powerfully
to the senses and the imagination&mdash;what are they, but the
very "poetry of motion," <i>la po&eacute;sie mise en action</i>, rendering words a
superfluous and feeble medium in comparison?</p>

<p>I saw at the Mint yesterday the medal struck in honour of Vigano,
bearing his head on one side, and on the other, Prometheus chained;
to commemorate his famous ballet of that name. One of these medals,
struck in gold, was presented to him in the name of the government:&mdash;a
singular distinction for a dancing-master;&mdash;but Vigano was a
dancing-master of <i>genius</i>; and this is the land, where genius in every
shape is deified.</p>

<p>The enchanting music of the Prometteo by Beethoven, is well known
in England, but to produce the ballet on our stage, as it was exhibited
here, would be impossible. The entire tribe of our dancers and figurantes,
with their jumpings, twirlings, quiverings, and pirouettings,
must be first annihilated; and Vigano, or Didelot, or Noverre rise
again to inform the whole corps de ballet with another soul and the
whole audience with another spirit:&mdash;for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Scioccamente '<i>ballar</i>' per dargli gusto."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The Theatre of the Scala, notwithstanding the vastness of my expectations,
did not disappoint me. I heard it criticised as being dark
and gloomy; for only the stage is illuminated: but when I remember
how often I have left our English theatres with dazzled eyes and aching
head,&mdash;distracted by the multiplicity of objects and faces, and "blasted
with excess of light,"&mdash;I feel reconciled to this peculiarity; more
especially as it heightens beyond measure the splendour of the stage
effect.</p>

<p>We have the Countess Bubna's box while we are here. She scarcely
ever goes herself, being obliged to hold a sort of military drawing-room
almost every evening. Her husband, General Bubna, has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
command of the Austrian forces in the north of Italy: and though the
Archduke Reinier is nominal viceroy, all real power seems lodged in
Bubna's bands. He it was who suppressed the insurrection in Piedmont
during the last struggle for liberty: 'twas his vocation&mdash;more
the pity. Eight hundred of the Milanese, at the head of them Count
Melzi, were connected with the Carbonari and the Piedmontese insurgents.
On Count Bubna's return from his expedition, a list of these
malcontents being sent to him by the police, he refused even to look at
it, and merely saying that it was the business of the police to <i>surveiller</i>
those persons, but <i>he</i> must be allowed to be ignorant of their names,
publicly tore the paper. The same night he visited the theatre, accompanied
by Count Melzi, was received with acclamations, and has
since been deservedly popular.</p>

<p>Bubna is a heavy gross-looking man, a victim to the gout, and with
nothing martial or captivating in his exterior. He has talents, however,
and those not only of a military cast. He was generally employed
to arrange the affairs of the Emperor of Austria with Napoleon.
His loyalty to his own sovereign, and the soldier-like frankness and
integrity of his character, gained him the esteem of the French emperor;
who, when any difficulties occurred in their arrangements, used
to say impatiently&mdash;"Envoyez-moi donc Bubna!"</p>

<p>The count is of an illustrious family of Alsace, which removed to
Bohemia when that province was ceded to France. He had nearly
ruined himself by gambling, when the emperor (so it is said) advised
him, or, in other words, commanded him to marry the daughter of
one Arnvelt or Arnfeldt, a baptized Jew, who had been servant to a
Jewish banker at Vienna; and on his death left a million of florins to
each of his daughters. He was a man of the lowest extraction, and
without any education; but having sense enough to feel its advantages,
he gave a most brilliant one to his daughters. The Countess Bubna is
an elegant, an accomplished, and has the character of being also an
amiable woman. She is here a person of the very first consequence,
the wife of the archduke alone taking precedence of her. A propos of
the viceroy, when on the Corso to-day with the Countess Bubna, we
met him with the <i>vice-queen</i>, as she is styled, here, walking in public.
The archduke has not (as the countess observed) <i>la plus jolie
tournure du monde</i>: his appearance is heavy, awkward, and slovenly,
with more than the usual Austrian stupidity of countenance: a complete
<i>testa tedesca</i>. His beautiful wife, the Princess Maria of Savoy,
to whom he has been married only a few months, held his arm; and
as she moved a little in front, seemed to drag him after her like a mere
appendage to her state. I gazed after them, amused by the contrast:
he looking like a dull, stiff, old bachelor, the very figure of Moody in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the Country Girl;&mdash;she, an elegant, sprightly, captivating creature;
decision in her step, laughter on her lips, and pride, intelligence, and
mischief in her brilliant eyes.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>We visited yesterday the military college, founded by the viceroy,
Eugene Beauharnois, for the children of soldiers who had fallen in
battle. The original design is now altered; and it has become a mere
public school, to which any boys may be admitted, paying a certain
sum a year. We went over the whole building, and afterwards saw
the scholars, two hundred and eighty in number, sit down to dinner.
Every thing appeared nice, clean, and admirably ordered. At the
Mint, which interested me extremely, we found them coining silver
crowns for the Levant trade, with the head of Maria Theresa, and the
date 1780. We were also shown the beautifully engraved die for the
medal which the university of Padua presented to Belzoni.</p>

<p>The evening was spent at the Teatro Re, where we saw a bad sentimental
comedy (una Commedia di Carattere) exceedingly well acted.
One actor I thought almost equal to Dowton, in his own style;&mdash;we
had afterwards some fine music. Some of the Milanese airs, which
the itinerant musicians give us, have considerable beauty and character.
There is less monotony, I think, in their general style than in the
Venetian music; and perhaps less sentiment, less softness. When left
alone to-night, to do penance on the sofa, for my late walks, and recruit
for our journey to-morrow,&mdash;I tried to adapt English verses to
one or two very pretty airs which Annoni brought me to-day, without
the Italian words; but it is a most difficult and invidious task.
Even Moore, with his unequalled command over the lyric harmonies
of our language, cannot perfectly satisfy ears accustomed to the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Linked sweetness long drawn out"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of the Italian vowels, combined with musical sounds: fancy such
dissonant syllables as <i>ex</i>, <i>pray</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>breaks</i>, <i>strength</i>, uttered in
minim time, hissing and grating through half a bar, instead of the
dulcet <i>anima mia</i>, <i>Catina amabile</i>&mdash;<i>Caro mio tesoro</i>, etc.</p>

<p>We left Milan two days ago, and arrived early the same day at
Brescia; there is, I believe, very little to see there, and of that little,
I saw nothing,&mdash;being too ill and too low for the slightest exertion.
The only pleasurable feeling I can remember was excited by our approach
to the Alps, after traversing the flat, fertile, uninteresting plains
of Lombardy. The peculiar sensation of elevation and delight, inspired
by mountain scenery, can only be understood by those who
have felt it: at least I never had formed an idea of it till I found myself
ascending the Jura.</p>

<p>But Brescia ought to be immortalized in the history of our travels:
for there, stalking down the Corso&mdash;<i>le nez en l'air</i>&mdash;we met our acquaintance
L&mdash;&mdash;, from whom we had parted last on the pav&eacute; of Piccadilly.
I remember that in London I used to think him not remarkable
for wisdom,&mdash;and his travels have infinitely improved him&mdash;in
folly. He boasted to us triumphantly that he had run over sixteen
thousand miles in sixteen months: that he had bowed at the lev&eacute;e of
the Emperor Alexander,&mdash;been slapped on the shoulder by the Archduke
Constantine,&mdash;shaken hands with a Lapland witch,&mdash;and been
presented in full volunteer uniform at every court between Stockholm
and Milan. Yet is he not one particle wiser than if he had spent the
same time in walking up and down the Strand. He has contrived,
however, to pick up on his tour, strange odds and ends of foreign follies,
which stick upon the coarse-grained materials of his own John Bull
character like tinfoil upon sackcloth: so that I see little difference
between what he was, and what he is, except that from a <i>simple goose</i>,&mdash;he
has become a compound one. With all this, L&mdash;&mdash; is not unbearable&mdash;not
<i>yet</i> at least. He amuses others as a butt&mdash;and me as a
specimen of a new genus of fools: for his folly is not like any thing
one usually meets with. It is not, <i>par exemple</i>, the folly of stupidity,
for he talks much; nor of dullness, for he laughs much; nor of ignorance,
for he has seen much; nor of wrong-headedness, for he can
be guided right; nor of bad-heartedness, for he is good-natured; nor
of thoughtlessness, for he is prudent; nor of extravagance, for he can
calculate even to the value of half a lira: but it is an essence of folly,
peculiar to himself, and like Monsieur Jacques's melancholy, "compounded
of many simples, extracted from various objects, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
sundry contemplation of his travels." So much, for the present, of
our friend L&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>We left Brescia early yesterday morning, and after passing Desenzano,
came in sight of the Lago di Garda. I had from early associations
a delightful impression of the beauty of this lake, and it did not
disappoint me. It is far superior, I think, to the Lago Maggiore,
because the scenery is more <i>resserr&egrave;</i>, lies in a smaller compass, so
that the eye takes in the separate features more easily. The mountains
to the north are dark, broken, and wild in their forms, and their bases
seemed to extend to the water edge: the hills to the south are smiling,
beautiful, and cultivated, studded with white flat-roofed buildings,
which glitter one above another in the sunshine. Our drive along the
promontory of Sirmione, to visit the ruins of the Villa of Catullus, was
delightful. The fresh breeze which ruffled the dark blue lake, revived
my spirits, and chased away my head-ache. I was inclined to be enchanted
with all I saw; and when our guide took us into an old cellar
choked with rubbish, and assured us gravely that it was the very spot
in which Catullus had written his Odes to Lesbia. I did not laugh in
his face; for, after all, it would be as easy to prove that <i>it is</i>, as that it
is <i>not</i>. The old town and castle of Sirmio are singularly picturesque,
whether viewed from above or below, and the grove of olives which
crowned the steep extremity of the promontory, interested us, being
the first we had seen in Italy: on the whole I fully enjoyed the early
part of this day.</p>

<p>At Peschiera, which is strongly fortified, we crossed the Mincio.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth-flowing Mincius crowned with vocal reeds.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Its waters were exquisitely transparent; but it was difficult to remember
its poetical pretensions, in sight of those odious barracks
and batteries. The reeds mentioned by Virgil and Milton still flourish
upon its banks, and I forgave them for spoiling in some degree the
beauty of the shore, when I thought of Adela&iuml;de of Burgundy, who
concealed herself among them for three days, when she fled from
the dungeon of Peschiera to the arms of her lover. I was glad I had
read her story in Gibbon, since it enabled me to add to classical and
poetical associations, an interest at once romantic and real.</p>

<p>The rest to-morrow&mdash;for I can write no more.</p>

<p><i>At Verona, Oct. 20.</i>&mdash;I had just written the above when I was
startled by a mournful strain from a chorus of voices, raised at intervals,
and approaching gradually nearer. I walked to the window, and saw
a long funeral procession just entering the church, which is opposite to
the door of our inn. I immediately threw over me a veil and shawl,
followed it, and stood by while the service was chaunted over the dead.
The scene, as viewed by the light of about two hundred tapers, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
were carried by the assistants, was as new to me as it was solemn and
striking; but it was succeeded by a strange and forlorn contrast. The
moment the service was over, the tapers were suddenly extinguished;
the priests and the relatives all disappeared in an inconceivably short
time, and before I was quite aware of what was going forward: the
coffin, stripped of its embroidered pall and garlands of flowers, appeared
a mere chest of deal boards, roughly nailed together; and
was left standing on tressels, bare, neglected, and forsaken in the
middle of the church. I approached it almost fearfully, and with a
deeper emotion than I believed such a thing could now excite within
me. And here, thought I, rests the human being, who has lived and
loved, suffered and enjoyed, and, if I may judge by the splendour of
his funeral rites, has been honoured, served, flattered while living:&mdash;and
now not one remains to shed a last tear over the dead, but a
single stranger, a wanderer from a land he perhaps knew not: to
whom his very name is unknown! And while thus I moralized, two
sextons appeared; and one of them seizing the miserable and deserted
coffin, rudely and unceremoniously flung it on his shoulders, and
vanished through a vaulted door; and I returned to my room, to write
this, and to think how much better, how much more <i>humanely</i>, we
manage these things in our own England.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 21.</i>&mdash;Verona is a clean and quiet place, containing some fine
edifices by Palladio and his pupils. The principal object of interest is
the ancient amphitheatre; the most perfect I believe in Italy. The
inner circle, with all its ranges of seats, is entire. We ascended to
the top, and looked down into the Piazza d'arme, where several battalions
of Austrian soldiers were exercising; their arms glittering
splendidly in the morning sun. As I have now been long enough in
Italy to sympathize in the national hatred of the Austrians, I turned
from the sight, resolved not to be pleased. The arena of the amphitheatre
is smaller, and less oval in form than I had expected: and in
the centre, there is a little paltry gaudy wooden theatre for puppets
and tumblers,&mdash;forming a grotesque contrast to the massive and majestic
architecture around it: but even tumblers and puppets, as Rospo
observed, are better than wild beasts and ferocious gladiators.</p>

<p>There are also at Verona a triumphal arch to the Emperor Gallienus;
the architecture and inscription almost as perfect as if erected
yesterday;&mdash;and a most singular bridge of three irregular arches,
built, I believe, by the Scaligieri family, who were once princes of
Verona.</p>

<p>It is well known that the story of Romeo and Juliet is here regarded
as a traditionary and indisputable fact, and the tomb of Juliet is shown
in a garden near the town. So much has been written and said on
this subject, I can add only one observation. To the reality of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
story it has been objected that the oldest narrator, Masuccio, relates it
as having happened at Sienna: but might he not have heard the tradition
at Verona, and transferred the scene to Sienna, since he represented
it as related by a Siennese?&mdash;Della Corte, whose history of
Verona I have just laid down, mentions it as a real historical event;
and Louis da Porta, in his beautiful novel, la Giulietta, expressly asserts
that he has written it down from tradition. If Shakespeare, as
it is said, never saw the novel of Da Porta, how came he by the names
of Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets: if he <i>did</i> meet
with it, how came he to depart so essentially from the story, particularly
in the catastrophe? I must get some books, if possible, to clear
up these difficulties.</p>

<p><i>23d, at Padua.</i>&mdash;We spent yesterday morning pleasantly at Vicenza.
Palladio's edifices in general <a name="disappointed" id="disappointed"></a>disappointed me; partly because
I am not architect enough to judge of their merits, partly because, of
most of them the situation is bad, and the materials paltry: but the
Olympic theatre, although its solid perspective be a mere trick of the
art, surprised and pleased me. It has an air of antique and classic
elegance in its decorations, which is very striking. I have heard it
criticised as a specimen of bad taste and trickery: but why should its
solid scenery be considered more a <i>trick</i>, and in bad taste, than a
curtain of painted canvas? In both a deception is practised and intended.
We saw many things in Vicenza and its neighbourhood,
which I have not time nor spirits, to dwell upon.</p>

<p>We arrived here (at Padua) last night, and to-day I am again ill:
unable to see or even to wish to see any thing. My eyes are so full of
tears that I can scarcely write. I must lay down my pencil, lest I
break through my resolution, and be tempted to record feelings I
afterwards tremble to see written down.&mdash;O bitter and too lasting remembrance!
I must sleep it away&mdash;even the heavy and drug-bought
sleep to which I am now reduced, is better than such waking moments
as these.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Venice, October 25th.</i>&mdash;I feel while I gaze round me, as if I had
seen Venice in my dreams&mdash;as if it were itself the vision of a dream.
We have been here two days; and I have not yet recovered from my
first surprise. All is yet enchantment: all is novel, extraordinary, affecting
from the many associations and remembrances excited in the
mind. Pleasure and wonder are tinged with a melancholy interest;
and while the imagination is excited, the spirits are depressed.</p>

<p>The morning we left Padua was bright, lovely, and cloudless. Our
drive along the shores of the Brenta crowned with innumerable villas
and gay gardens was delightful; and the moment of our arrival at
Fusina, where we left our carriages to embark in gondolas, was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
most auspicious that could possibly have been chosen. It was about
four o'clock: the sun was just declining towards the west: the whole
surface of the <i>lagune</i>, smooth as a mirror, appeared as if paved with
fire;&mdash;and Venice, with her towers and domes, indistinctly glittering
in the distance, rose before us like a gorgeous exhalation from the
bosom of the ocean. It is farther from the shore than I expected. As
we approached, the splendour faded: but the interest and wonder
grew. I can conceive nothing more beautiful, more singular, more
astonishing, than the first appearance of Venice, and sad indeed will
be the hour when she sinks (as the poet prophesies) "into the slime of
her own canals."</p>

<p>The moment we had disembarked our luggage at the inn, we hired
gondolas and rowed to the Piazza di San Marco. Had I seen the
church of St. Mark any where else, I should have exclaimed against
the bad taste which every where prevails in it: but Venice is the proper
region of the fantastic, and the church of St. Mark&mdash;with its four
hundred pillars of every different order, colour, and material, its oriental
cupolas, and glittering vanes, and gilding and mosaics&mdash;assimilates
with all around it: and the kind of pleasure it gives is suitable to
the place and the people.</p>

<p>After dinner I had a chair placed on the balcony of our inn, and sat
for some time contemplating a scene altogether new and delightful.
The arch of the Rialto just gleamed through the deepening twilight;
long lines of palaces, at first partially illuminated, faded away at length
into gloomy and formless masses of architecture; the gondolas glided
to and fro, their glancing lights reflected on the water. There was a
stillness all around me, solemn and strange in the heart of a great city.
No rattling carriages shook the streets, no trampling of horses echoed
along the pavement: the silence was broken only by the melancholy
cry of the gondoliers, and the dash of their oars; by the low murmur
of human voices, by the chime of the vesper bells, borne over the water,
and the sounds of music raised at intervals along the canals. The poetry,
the romance of the scene stole upon me unawares. I fell into a reverie,
in which visionary forms and recollections gave way to dearer
and sadder realities, and my mind seemed no longer in my own power.
I called upon the lost, the absent, to share the present with me,&mdash;I
called upon past feelings to enhance that moment's delight. I did
wrong&mdash;and memory avenged herself as usual. I quitted my seat on
the balcony, with despair at my heart, and drawing to the table, took
out my books and work. So passed our first evening at Venice.</p>

<p>Yesterday we visited the Accademia where there are some fine pictures.
The famous assumption by Titian is here, and first made me
<i>feel</i> what connoisseurs mean when they talk of the carnations and draperies
of Titian. We were shown two designs for monuments to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
memory of Titian, modelled by Canova. Neither of them has been
erected; but the most beautiful, with a little alteration, and the substitution
of a lady's bust for Titian's venerable head, has been dedicated,
I believe, to the memory of the Archduchess Christina of Austria. I
remember also an exquisite Canaletti, quite different in style and subject
from any picture of this master I ever saw.</p>

<p>We then rowed to the ducal palace. The council chamber (I
thought of Othello as I entered it) is now converted into a library.
The walls are decorated with the history of Pope Alexander the Third,
and Frederic Barbarossa, painted by the Tintoretti, father and son,
Paul Veronese and Palma. Above them, in compartments, hang the
portraits of the Doges; among which Marino Faliero is <i>not</i>; but his
name only, inscribed on a kind of black pall. The Ganymede is a
most exquisite little group, attributed to the age of Praxiteles; and not
without reason even to the hand of that sculptor.</p>

<p>To-day we visited several churches&mdash;rich, on the outside, with all
the luxury of architecture,&mdash;withinside, gorgeous with painting, sculpture,
and many-coloured marbles. The prodigality with which the
most splendid and costly materials are lavished here is perfectly
amazing: pillars of lapis-lazuli, columns of Egyptian porphyry, and
pavements of mosaic, altars of alabaster ascended by steps incrusted
with agate and jasper:&mdash;but to particularize would be in vain. I will
only mention three or four which I wish to recollect: the Church of
the Madonna della Salute, so called because erected to the Virgin in
gratitude for the deliverance of the city from a pestilence, which she
miraculously drove into the Adriatic. It is remarkable for its splendid
pictures, most of them by Luca Giordano; and the superb high altar.
I think it was the Church of the Gesuata which astonished us most.
The whole of the inside walls and columns are encrusted with Carrara
marble inlaid with verd-antique, in a kind of damask pattern; over the
pulpit it fell like drapery, so easy, so graceful, so exquisitely imitated,
that I was obliged to touch it to assure myself of the material. Then
by way of contrast followed the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore,&mdash;one
of Palladio's masterpieces. After the dazzling and gorgeous
buildings we had left, its beautiful simplicity and correct taste struck
me at first with an impression of poverty and coldness. At the Church
of St. John and St. Paul is the famous martyrdom, <a name="or" id="or"></a>or rather assassination,
of St. Peter Martyr, by Titian, one of the most magical pictures
in the world. Its tragic horror is redeemed by its sublimity. Here
too is a most admirable series of bas-reliefs in white marble, representing
the history of our Saviour, the work of a modern sculptor. Here too
the Doges are buried; and close to the Church is the equestrian statue
of one of the Falieri family: near which Marino Faliero met the
conspirators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Frati is the grave of Titian: a small square slab covers him,
with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Qui giace il gran Tiziano Vecelli.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emulator dei Zeusi e degli Apelli."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>there is no monument:&mdash;and there needs none.</p>

<p>It was, I think, in the Church of St. John and St. Paul, that I saw a
singular and beautiful altar of black touch-stone, used when mass is
said for the soul of an executed criminal.</p>

<p>This is all I can remember of to-day. I am fatigued, and my head
aches;&mdash;my imagination is yet dazzled:&mdash;my eyes are tired of
admiring, my mind is tired of thinking, and my heart with feeling.&mdash;&mdash;Now
for repose.</p>

<p><i>27.</i>&mdash;To-day we visited the Manfrini Palace, the Casa Pisani, the
Palazzo Barberigo, and concluded the morning in the colonnade of St.
Mark, and the public gardens. The day has been far less fatiguing
than yesterday: for though we have seen an equal variety of
objects, they forced the attention less, and gratified the imagination
more.</p>

<p>At the Manfrini Palace there is the most valuable and splendid
collection of pictures I have yet seen in Italy or elsewhere. I have
no intention of turning my little Diary into a mere catalogue of names
which I can find in every guide-book; but I cannot pass over
Giorgione's beautiful group of himself, and his wife and child, which
Lord Byron calls "love at full length and life, not love ideal," and it
is indeed exquisite. A female with a guitar by the same master is
almost equal to it. There are two Lucretias&mdash;one by Guido and one
by Giordano: though both are beautiful, particularly the former, there
was, I thought, an impropriety in the conception of both pictures: the
figure was too voluptuous&mdash;too exposed, and did not give me the idea
of the matronly Lucretia, who so carefully arranged her drapery
before she fell. I remember, too, a St. Cecilia by Carlo Dolci, of
most heavenly beauty,&mdash;two Correggios&mdash;Iphigenia in Aulis, by
Padovanino: in this picture the figure of Agamemnon is a complete
failure, but the lifeless beauty of Iphigenia, a wonderful effort of art:
and a hundred others at least, all masterpieces.</p>

<p>The Barberigo Palace was the school of Titian. We were shown
the room in which he painted, and the picture he left unfinished when
he died at the age of 99. It is a David&mdash;as vigorous in the touch and
style as any of his first pictures.</p>

<p>It is now some days since I had time to write; or rather the intervals
of excitement and occupation found me too much exhausted to
take up my pencil. Our stay at Venice has been rendered most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
agreeable by the kindness of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, the British Consul, and his
amiable and charming wife, and in their society we have spent much
of the last few days.</p>

<p>One of our pleasantest excursions was to the Armenian convent of
St. Lazaro, where we were received by Fra Pasquale, an accomplished
and intelligent monk, and a particular friend of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;. After
we had visited every part of the convent, the printing press&mdash;the library&mdash;the
laboratory&mdash;which contains several fine mathematical instruments
of English make; and admired the beautiful little tame gazelle
which bounded through the corridors, we were politely refreshed with
most delicious sweetmeats and coffee; and took leave of Fra Pasquale
with regret.</p>

<p>There is no opera at present, but we have visited both the other
theatres. At the San Luca, they gave us "Elizabeth, the Exile of
Siberia," tolerably acted: but there was one trait introduced very
characteristic of the place and people: Elizabeth in a tremendous snow
storm, is pursued by robbers; and finding a crucifix, erected by the
road side, embraces it for protection. The crucifix flies away with
her in a clap of thunder, and sets her down safely at a distance from
her persecutors. The audience appeared equally enchanted and edified
by this scene: some of the women near me crossed themselves, and
put their handkerchiefs to their eyes: the men rose from their seats,
clapped with enthusiasm, and shouted "Bravo! Miracolo!"</p>

<p>At the San Benedetto we were gratified by a deep tragedy entitled
"Gabrielle Innocente," so exquisitely absurd, and so grotesquely
acted, that the best comedy could scarcely have afforded us more
amusement,&mdash;certainly not more <i>merriment</i>. In the course of the
evening, coffee and ices were served in our box, as is the custom here.</p>

<p>With Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; this evening I had a long and pleasant conversation;
she is really one of the most delightful and unaffected women I
ever met with: and as there is nothing in my melancholy visage and
shrinking reserve to tempt any person to converse with me, I must
also set her down as one of the most good-natured. She talked much
of Lord Byron, with whom, during his residence here she was on
intimate terms. She spoke of him, not conceitedly as one vain of the
acquaintance of a great character; nor with affected reserve, as if afraid
of committing herself&mdash;but with openness, animation, and cordial
kindness, as one whom she liked, and had reason to like. She says
the style of Lord Byron's conversation is very much that of Don Juan:
just in the same manner are the familiar, the brilliant, the sublime,
the affecting, the witty, the ludicrous, and the licentious, mingled
and contrasted. Several little anecdotes which she related I need not
write down; I can scarcely forget them, and it would not be quite fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
as they were told <i>en confiance</i>. I am no anecdote hunter, picking up
articles for "my pocket book."</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>A little while ago Captain F. lent me D'Israeli's Essays on the Literary
Character, which had once belonged to Lord Byron; and contained
marginal notes in his hand-writing. One or two of them are
so curiously characteristic that I copy them here.</p>

<p>The first note is on a passage in which D'Israeli, in allusion to Lord
Byron, traces his fondness for oriental scenery to his having read
Rycaut at an early age. On this Lord Byron observes, that he read
<i>every book</i> relating to the east before he was ten years old, including
De Tott and Cantemir as well as Rycaut: at that age, he says that he
<i>detested</i> all poetry, and adds, "when I was in Turkey, I was oftener
tempted to turn mussulman than poet: and have often regretted
since that <i>I did not</i>."</p>

<p>At page 99 D'Israeli says,</p>

<p>"The great poetical genius of our times has openly alienated himself
from the land of his brothers" (over the word <i>brothers</i> Lord
Byron has written <i>Cains</i>.) "He becomes immortal in the <i>language</i>
of a <i>people</i> whom he would <i>contemn</i>, he accepts with ingratitude the
fame he loves more than life, and he is only truly great on that <i>spot</i> of
<i>earth</i>, whose genius, when he is no more, will contemplate his shade
in sorrow and in anger."</p>

<p>Lord Byron has underlined several words in this passage, and
writes thus in the margin:</p>

<p>"What was rumoured of me in that language, if <i>true</i>, I was unfit
for England; and if <i>false</i>, England was unfit for me. But 'there is
a world elsewhere.' I have never for an instant regretted that
country,&mdash;but often that I ever returned to it. It is not my fault that
I am obliged to write in English. If I understood any present language,
Italian, for instance, equally well, I would write in it:&mdash;but
it will require ten years, at least, to form a style. No tongue so easy
to acquire a little of, and so difficult to master thoroughly, as Italian."</p>

<p>The next note is amusing; at page 342 is mentioned the anecdote of
Petrarch, who when returning to his native town, was informed that
the proprietor of the house in which he was born had <i>often</i> wished to
make alterations in it, but that the town's-people had risen to insist
that the house consecrated by his birth should <a name="remain" id="remain"></a>remain unchanged;&mdash;"a
triumph," adds D'Israeli, "more affecting to Petrarch than even
his coronation at Rome."</p>

<p>Lord Byron has written in the margin&mdash;"It would have pained <i>me</i>
more that the proprietor should <i>often</i> have wished to make alterations,
than it would give me pleasure that the rest of Arezzo rose against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
his right (for <i>right</i> he had:) the depreciation of the lowest of mankind
is more painful, than the applause of the highest is pleasing. The
sting of the scorpion is more in <i>torture</i> than the possession of any
thing short of Venus would be in rapture."</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>The public gardens are the work of the French, and occupy the extremity
of one of the islands. They contain the only trees I have seen
at Venice:&mdash;a few rows of dwarfish unhappy-looking shrubs, parched
by the sea breezes, and are little frequented. We found here a solitary
gentleman, who was sauntering up and down with his hands in his
pockets, and a look at once stupid and disconsolate. Sometimes he
paused, looked vacantly over the waters, whistled, yawned, and turned
away to resume his solemn walk. On a trifling remark addressed to
him by one of our party, he entered into conversation, with all the
eagerness of a man, whose tongue had long been kept in most unnatural
bondage. He congratulated himself on having met with some
one who would speak English; adding contemptuously, that "he understood
none of the outlandish tongues the people spoke hereabouts:" he
inquired what was to be seen here, for though he had been four days
in Venice, he had spent every day precisely in the same manner; viz.
walking up and down the public gardens. We told him Venice was
famous for fine buildings and pictures; he knew nothing of <i>them</i> things.
And that it contained also, "some fine statues and antiques"&mdash;he cared
nothing about them neither&mdash;he should set off for Florence the next
morning, and begged to know what was to be seen there? Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;
told him, with enthusiasm, "the most splendid gallery of pictures and
statues in the world!" He looked very blank and disappointed. "Nothing
else?" then he should certainly not waste his time at Florence,
he should go direct to Rome; he had put down the name of that <i>town</i>
in his pocket-book, for he understood it was a very <i>convenient</i> place:
he should therefore stay there a week; thence he should go to Naples,
a place he had also heard of, where he should stay another week:
then he should go to Algiers, where he should stay <i>three weeks</i>, and
thence to Tunis, where he expected to be very comfortable, and should
probably make a long stay; thence he should return home, having seen
every thing worth seeing. He scarcely seemed to know how or by
what route he had got to Venice&mdash;but he assured us he had come "fast
enough;"&mdash;he remembered no place he had passed through except
Paris. At Paris he told us there was a female lodging in the same
hotel with himself, who by his description appears to have been a single
lady of rank and fashion, travelling with her own carriages and a suite
of servants. He had never seen her; but learning through the domestics
that she was travelling the same route, he sat down and wrote her a
long letter, beginning "Dear Madam," and proposing they should join<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
company, "for the sake of good fellowship, and the <i>bit of chat</i> they
might have on their way." Of course she took no notice of this strange
billet, "from which," added he with ludicrous simplicity, "I supposed
she would rather travel alone."</p>

<p>Truly, "Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time." After
this specimen, sketched from life, who will say there are such things
as caricatures?</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>We visited to-day the Giant's Staircase and the Bridge of Sighs, and
took a last farewell of St. Mark&mdash;we were surprised to see the church
hung with black&mdash;the festoons of flowers all removed&mdash;masses going
forward at several altars, and crowds of people looking particularly solemn
and devout. It is the "Giorno dei morte," the day by the Roman
Catholics consecrated to the dead. I observed many persons, both men
and women, who wept while they prayed, with every appearance of
the most profound grief. Leaving St. Mark, I crossed the square. On
the three lofty standards in front of the church formerly floated the
ensigns of the three states subjects to Venice,&mdash;the Morea, Cyprus, and
Candia: the bare poles remain, but the ensigns of empire are gone.
One of the standards was extended on the ground, and being of immense
length, I hesitated for a moment whether I should make a circuit,
but at last stepped over it. I looked back with remorse, for it
was like trampling over the fallen.</p>

<p>We then returned to our inn to prepare for our departure. How I
regret to leave Venice! not the less because I cannot help it.</p>

<p><i>Rovigo, Nov. 3.</i> We left Venice in a hurry yesterday, slept at
Padua, and travelled this morning through a most lovely country,
among the Enganean hills to Rovigo, where we are very uncomfortably
lodged at the Albergo di San Marco.</p>

<p>I have not yet recovered my regret at leaving Venice so unexpectedly;
though as a residence, I could scarce endure it; the sleepy canals, the
gliding gondolas in their "dusk livery of woe"&mdash;the absence of all
verdure, all variety&mdash;of all <i>nature</i>, in short; the silence, disturbed
only by the incessant chiming of bells&mdash;and, worse than all, the spectacle
of a great city "expiring," as Lord Byron says, "before our
eyes," would give me the horrors: but as a visitor, my curiosity was
not half gratified, and I should have liked to have stayed a few days
longer&mdash;<a name="perhaps" id="perhaps"></a>perhaps after all, I have reason to rejoice that instead of bringing
away from Venice a disagreeable impression of satiety, disgust and
melancholy, I have quitted it with feelings of admiration, of deep regret,
and undiminished interest.</p>

<p>Farewell, then, Venice! I could not have believed it possible that
it would have brought tears to my eyes to leave a place merely for its
own sake, and unendeared by the presence of any one I loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>As Rovigo affords no other amusement I shall scribble a little longer.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more arbitrary than the Austrian government at
Venice. As a summary method of preventing robberies during the
winter months, when many of the gondoliers and fishermen are out of
employ, the police have orders to arrest, without ceremony, every
person who has no permanent trade or profession, and keep them in
confinement and to hard labour till the return of spring.</p>

<p>The commerce of Venice has so much and so rapidly declined, that
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; told us when first he was appointed to the consulship, a
hundred and fifty English vessels cleared the port, and this year only
five. It should seem that Austria, from a cruel and selfish policy, is
sacrificing Venice to the prosperity of Trieste: but why do I call that
a cruel policy, which on recollection I might rather term poetical and
retributive justice?</p>

<p>The grandeur of Venice arose first from its trade in salt. I remember
reading in history, that when the king of Hungary opened
certain productive salt mines in his dominions, the Venetians sent him
a peremptory order to shut them up; and such was the power of the
Republic at that time, that he was forced to obey this insolent command,
to the great injury and impoverishment of his states. The
tables are now turned; the oppressor has become the oppressed.</p>

<p>The principal revenue derived from Venice is from the tax on
houses, there being no <i>land tax</i>. So rapid was the decay of the place,
that in two years seventy houses and palaces were pulled down; the
government forbade this by a special law, and now taxes are paid for
many houses whose proprietors are too poor to live in them.</p>

<p>There is no <i>society</i>, properly so called, at Venice; three old women
of rank receive company now and then, and it is any thing rather
than select.</p>

<p>Mr. F. told us at Venice, that on entering the states subject to
Austria, he had his Johnson's Dictionary taken from him, and could
never recover it; so jealous is the government of English principles
and English literature, that <i>all</i> English books are prohibited until examined
by the police.</p>

<p>The whole country from Milan to Padua was like a vast garden,
nothing could exceed its fertility and beauty. It was the latter end of
the vintage; and we frequently met huge tub-like waggons loaded
with purple grapes, reeling home from the vineyards, and driven by
men whose legs were stained with treading in the wine-press&mdash;now
and then, rich clusters were shaken to the ground, as I have seen
wisps of straw fall from a hay-cart in England, and were regarded
with equal indifference. Sometimes we saw in the vineyards by the
road-side, groups of labourers seated among the branches of the trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and plucking grapes from the vines, which were trailed gracefully from
tree to tree and from branch to branch, and drooped with their luxurious
burthen of fruit. The scene would have been as perfectly delightful,
as it was new and beautiful, but for the squalid looks of the peasantry;
more especially of the women. The principal productions of the country
seem to be wine and silk. There were vast groves of mulberry-trees
between Verona and Padua; and we visited some of the silk-mills,
in which the united strength of men invariably performed those
operations which in England are accomplished by steam or water. I
saw in a huge horizontal wheel, about a dozen of these poor creatures
labouring so hard, that my very heart ached to see them, and I
begged that the machine might be stopped that I might speak to them:&mdash;but
when it W<i>as</i> stopped, and I beheld their half savage, half stupified,
I had almost said <i>brutified</i> countenances, I could not utter a single
word&mdash;but gave them something, and turned away.</p>

<p>"Compassion is wasted upon such creatures," said R&mdash;&mdash;; "do
you not see that their minds are degraded down to their condition?
they do not pity themselves:"&mdash;but therefore did I pity them the
more.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Bologna, Nov. 5.</i>&mdash;I fear I shall retain a disagreeable impression of
Bologna, for here I am again ill. I have seen little of what the town
contains of beautiful and curious: and that little, under unpleasant
and painful circumstances.</p>

<p>Yesterday we passed through Ferrara; only stopping to change
horses and dine. We snatched a moment to visit the hospital of St.
Anna and the prison of Tasso&mdash;the glory and disgrace of Ferrara.
Over the iron gate is written "Ingresso alia prigione di Torquato
Tasso." The cell itself is miserably gloomy and wretched, and not
above twelve feet square. How amply has posterity avenged the
cause of the poet on his tyrant!&mdash;and as we emerge from his obscure
dungeon and descend the steps of the hospital of St. Anna, with what
fervent hatred, indignation, and scorn, do we gaze upon the towers of
the ugly red brick palace, or rather fortress, which deforms the great
square, and where Alphonso feasted while Tasso wept! The inscription
on the door of the cell, calling on strangers to venerate the spot
where Tasso, "Infermo pi&ugrave; di tristezza che delirio," was confined
seven years and one month&mdash;was placed there by the French, and its
accuracy may be doubted; as far as I can recollect. The grass growing
in the wide streets of Ferrara is no poetical exaggeration; I saw it
rank and long even on the thresholds of the deserted houses, whose
sashless windows, and flapping doors, and roofless walls, looked
strangely desolate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>I will say nothing of Bologna;&mdash;for the few days I have spent here
have been to me days of acute suffering, in more ways than I wish to
remember, and therefore dare not dwell upon.</p>

<p><i>At Covigliajo in the Apennines.</i>&mdash;O for the pencil of Salvator, or
the pen of a Radcliffe! But could either, or could both united, give
to my mind the scenes of to-day, in all their splendid combinations of
beauty and brightness, gloom and grandeur? A picture may present
to the eye a small portion of the boundless whole&mdash;one aspect of the
every-varying face of nature; and words, how weak are they!&mdash;they
are but the elements out of which the quick imagination frames and
composes lovely landscapes, according to its power or its peculiar character;
and in which the unimaginative man finds only a mere chaos
of verbiage, without form, and void.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Apennines is altogether different in character
from that of the Alps: it is less bold, less lofty, less abrupt and terrific&mdash;but
more beautiful, more luxuriant, and infinitely more varied.
At one time, the road wound among precipices and crags, crowned
with dismantled fortresses and ruined castles&mdash;skirted with dark pine
forests&mdash;and opening into wild recesses of gloom, and immeasurable
depths like those of Tartarus profound; then came such glimpses of
paradise! such soft sunny valleys and peaceful hamlets&mdash;and vine-clad
eminences and rich pastures, with here and there a convent half
hidden by groves of cypress and cedars. As we ascended we arrived
at a height from which, looking back, we could see the whole of Lombardy
spread at our feet; a vast, glittering, indistinct landscape,
bounded on the north by the summits of the Alps, just apparent above
the horizon, like a range of small silvery clouds; and on the east a
long unbroken line of bluish light marked the far distant Adriatic; as
the day declined, and we continued our ascent (occasionally assisted by
a yoke of oxen where the acclivity was very precipitate), the mountains
closed around us, the scenery became more wildly romantic,
barren, and bleak. At length, after passing the crater of a volcano,
visible through the gloom by its dull red light, we arrived at the Inn
of <a name="Covigliajo33" id="Covigliajo33"></a>Covigliajo, an uncouth dreary edifice, situated in a lonely and desolate
spot, some miles from any other habitation. This is the very inn,
infamous for a series of the most horrible assassinations, committed
here some years ago. Travellers arrived, departed, disappeared,
and were never heard of more; by what agency, or in what manner
disposed of, could not be discovered. It was supposed for some time
that a horde of banditti were harboured among the mountains, and
the police were for a long time in active search for them, while the
real miscreants remained unsuspected for their seeming insignificance
and helplessness; these were the mistress of the inn, the cameri&egrave;re,
and the curate of the nearest village, about two leagues off. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
secretly murdered every traveller who was supposed to carry property&mdash;buried
or burned their clothes, packages, and vehicles, retaining
nothing but their watches, jewels, and money. The whole story,
with all its horrors, the manner of discovery, and the fate of these
wretches, is told, I think, by Forsyth, who can hardly be suspected
of romance or exaggeration. I have him not with me to refer to; but
I well remember the mysterious and shuddering dread with which I
read the anecdote. I am glad no one else seems to recollect it. The
inn at present contains many more than it can possibly accommodate.
We have secured the best rooms, or rather the <i>only</i> rooms&mdash;and besides
ourselves and other foreigners, there are numbers of native travellers:
some of whom arrived on horseback, and others with the
Vetturini. A kind of gallery or corridor separates the sleeping rooms,
and is divided by a curtain into two parts: the smaller is appropriated
to us, as a saloon: the other half, as I contemplate it at this moment
through a rent in the curtain, presents a singular and truly Italian
spectacle&mdash;a huge black iron lamp, suspended by a chain from the
rafters, throws a flaring and shifting light around. Some trusses of
hay have been shaken down upon the floor, to supply the place of
beds, chairs, and tables; and there, reclining in various attitudes, I
see a number of dark looking figures, some eating and drinking, some
sleeping; some playing at cards, some telling stories with all the
Italian variety of gesticulation and intonation; some silently looking
on, or listening. Two or three common looking fellows began to
smoke their segars, but when it was suggested that this might incommode
the ladies on the other side of the curtain, they with genuine
politeness ceased directly. Through this motley and picturesque assemblage
I have to make my way to my bed-room in a few minutes&mdash;I
will take another look at them, and then&mdash;andiamo!</p>

<p><i>Florence, Nov. 8.</i>&mdash;"La bellisema e famosissima figlia di Roma,"
as Dante calls her in some relenting moment. Last night we slept in
a blood-stained hovel&mdash;and to-night we are lodged in a palace. So
much for the vicissitudes of travelling.</p>

<p>I am not subject to idle fears, and least of all to superstitious fears&mdash;but
last night, at Covigliajo, I could not sleep&mdash;I could not even lie
down for more than a few minutes together. The whispered voices
and hard breathing of the men who slept in the corridor, from whom
only a slight door divided me, disturbed and fevered my nerves; horrible
imaginings were all around me: and gladly did I throw open my
window at the first glimpse of the dawn, and gladly did I hear the
first well-known voice which summoned me to a hasty breakfast.
How reviving was the breath of the early morning, after leaving that
close, suffocating, ill-omened inn! how beautiful the blush of light
stealing downwards from the illumined summits to the valleys, tinting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the fleecy mists, as they rose from the earth, till all the landscape was
flooded with sunshine: and when at length we passed the mountains,
and began to descend into the rich vales of Tuscany&mdash;when from the
heights above Fesole we beheld the city of Florence, and above it the
young moon and the evening star suspended side by side; and floating
over the whole of the Val d'Arno, and the lovely hills which enclose it,
a mist, or rather a suffusion of the richest rose colour, which gradually,
as the day declined, faded, or rather deepened into purple;
then I first understood all the enchantment of an Italian landscape.&mdash;O
what a country is this! All that I see, I <i>feel</i>&mdash;all that I <i>feel</i>, sinks
so deep into my heart and my memory! the deeper because I suffer&mdash;and
because I never think of expressing, or sharing, one emotion
with those around me, but lock it up in my own bosom; or at least in
my little book&mdash;as I do now.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 10.</i>&mdash;We visited the gallery for the first time yesterday morning;
and I came away with my eyes and imagination so dazzled with
excellence, and so distracted with variety, that I retained no distinct
recollection of any particular object except the Venus; which of course
was the first and great attraction. This morning was much more
delightful; my powers of discrimination returned, and my power of
enjoyment was not diminished. New perceptions of beauty and excellence
seemed to open upon my mind; and faculties long dormant,
were roused to pleasurable activity.</p>

<p>I came away untired, unsated; and with a delightful and distinct
impression of all I had seen. I leave to catalogues to particularise;
and am content to admire and to remember.</p>

<p>I am glad I was not disappointed in the Venus which I half expected.
Neither was I surprised: but I felt while I gazed a sense of unalloyed
and unmingled pleasure, and forgot the cant of criticism. It
has the same effect to the eye, that perfect harmony has upon the ear:
and I think I can understand why no copy, cast, or model, however
accurate, however exquisite, can convey the impression of tenderness
and sweetness, the divine and peculiar charm of the original.</p>

<p>After dinner we walked in the grounds of the Cascine,&mdash;a dairy
farm belonging to the grand Duke, just without the gates of Florence.
The promenade lies along the bank of the river, and is sheltered and
beautiful. We saw few native Italians, but great numbers of English
walking and riding. The day was as warm, as sunny, as brilliant as
the first days of September in England.</p>

<p>To-night, after resting a little, I went out to view the effect of the
city and surrounding scenery, by moonlight. It is not alone the brilliant
purity of the skies and atmosphere, nor the peculiar character of
the scenery which strikes a stranger; but here art harmonizes with
nature: the style of the buildings, their flat projecting roofs, white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
walls, balconies, colonnades and statues, are all set off to advantage by
the radiance of an Italian moon.</p>

<p>I walked across the first bridge, from which I had a fine view of the
Ponte della Trinit&agrave;, with its graceful arches and light balustrade,
touched with the sparkling moonbeams and relieved by dark shadow:
then I strolled along the quay in front of the Corsini palace, and
beyond the colonnade of the Uffizi, to the last of the four bridges; on
the middle of which I stood and looked back upon the city&mdash;(how
justly styled the Fair!)&mdash;with all its buildings, its domes, its steeples,
its bridges, and woody hills and glittering convents, and marble villas,
peeping from embowering olives and cypresses; and far off the snowy
peaks of the Apennines, shining against the dark purple sky: the
whole blended together in one delicious scene of shadowy splendour.
After contemplating it with a kind of melancholy delight, long
enough to get it by heart, I returned homewards. Men were standing
on the wall along the Arno, in various picturesque attitudes, fishing,
after the Italian fashion, with singular nets suspended to long poles;
and as I saw their dark figures between me and the moonlight, and
elevated above my eye, they looked like colossal statues. I then
strayed into the Piazza del Gran Duca. Here the rich moonlight,
streaming through the arcade of the gallery, fell directly upon the fine
Perseus of Benvenuto Cellini; and illuminating the green bronze,
touched it with a spectral and supernatural beauty. Thence I walked
round the equestrian statue of Cosmo, and so home over the Ponte Alla
Carrajo.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 11.</i>&mdash;I spent about two hours in the gallery, and for the first
time saw the Niobe. This statue has been for a long time a favourite
of my imagination, and I approached it, treading softly and slowly,
and with a feeling of reverence; for I had an impression that the original
Niobe would, like the original Venus, surpass all the casts and
copies I had seen both in beauty and expression: but apparently expression
is more easily caught than delicacy and grace, and the grandeur
and pathos of the attitude and grouping easily copied&mdash;for I think
the best casts of the Niobe are accurate counterparts of the original;
and at the first glance I was capriciously disappointed, because the
statue did not <i>surpass</i> my expectations. It should be contemplated
from a distance. It is supposed that the whole group once ornamented
the pediment of a temple&mdash;probably the temple of Diana or Latona.
I once saw a beautiful drawing by Mr. Cockerell, of the manner in
which he supposed the whole group was distributed. Many of the
figures are rough and unfinished at the back, as if they had been placed
on a height, and viewed only in front.</p>

<p>In the same room with the Niobe is a head which struck me more&mdash;the
<i>Alexandre mourant</i>. The title seemed to me misapplied; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
there is something indignant and upbraiding, as well as mournful, in
the expression of this magnificent head. It is undoubtedly Alexander&mdash;but
Alexander reproaching the gods&mdash;or calling upon Heaven for
new worlds to conquer.</p>

<p>I visited also the gallery of Bronzes: it contains, among other
master-pieces, the a&euml;rial Mercury of John of Bologna, of which we
see such a multiplicity of copies. There is a conceit in perching him
upon the bluff cheeks of a little Eolus: but what exquisite lightness in
the figure!&mdash;how it mounts, how it floats, disdaining the earth! On
leaving the gallery, I sauntered about; visited some churches, and
then returned home depressed and wearied: and in this melancholy
humour I had better close my book, lest I be tempted to write what I
could not bear to see written.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;At the English ambassador's chapel. To attend public
worship among our own countrymen, and hear the praises of God in
our native accents, in a strange land, among a strange people; where a
different language, different manners, and a different religion prevail,
affects the mind, or at least ought to affect it;&mdash;and deeply too: yet I
cannot say that I felt devout this morning. The last day I visited St.
Mark's, when I knelt down beside the poor weeping girl and her dove-basket,
my heart was touched, and my prayers, I humbly trust, were
not unheard: to-day, in that hot close crowded room, among those
fine people flaunting in all the luxury of dress, I felt suffocated, feverish,
and my head ached&mdash;the clergyman too&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Samuel Rogers paid us a long visit this morning. He does not look
as if the suns of Italy had <i>revivified</i> him&mdash;but he is as <i>amiable</i> and
amusing as ever. He talked long, <i>et avec beaucoup d'onction</i>, of ortolans
and figs; till methought it was the very poetry of epicurism; and
put me in mind of his own suppers&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where blushing fruits through scatter'd leaves invite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still clad in bloom and veiled in azure light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine as rich in years as Horace sings;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the rest of his description, worthy of a poetical Apicius.</p>

<p>Rogers may be seen every day about eleven or twelve in the Tribune,
seated opposite to the Venus, which appears to be the exclusive object
of his adoration; and gazing, as if he hoped, like another Pygmalion,
to animate the statue; or rather perhaps that the statue might animate
<i>him</i>. A young Englishman of fashion, with as much talent as espieglerie,
placed an epistle in verse between the fingers of the statue, addressed
to Rogers; in which the goddess entreats him not to come
there <i>ogling</i> every day;&mdash;for though "partial friends might deem him
still alive," she knew by his looks that he had come from the other
side of the Styx; and retained her <i>antique</i> abhorrence of the spectral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
dead, etc. etc. She concluded by beseeching him, if he could not desist
from haunting her with his <i>ghostly</i> presence, at least to spare
her the added misfortune of being be-rhymed by his muse.</p>

<p>Rogers, with equal good nature and good sense, neither noticed these
lines nor withdrew his friendship and intimacy from the writer.</p>

<p>Carlo Dolce is not one of my favourite masters. There is a cloying
sweetness in his style, a general want of power which wearies me: yet
I brought away from the Corsini Palace to-day an impression of a head
by Carlo Dolce (La Poesia), which I shall never forget. Now I recall
the picture, I am at a loss to tell where lies the charm which has thus
powerfully seized on my imagination. Here are no "eyes upturned
like one inspired"&mdash;no distortion&mdash;no rapt enthusiasm&mdash;no Muse full
of the God;&mdash;but it is a head so purely, so divinely intellectual, so
heavenly sweet, and yet so penetrating,&mdash;so full of sensibility, and yet
so unstained by earthly passion&mdash;so brilliant, and yet so calm&mdash;that if
Carlo Dolce had lived in our days, I should have thought he intended
it for the personified genius of Wordsworth's poetry. There is such an
individual reality about this beautiful head, that I am inclined to believe
the tradition, that it is the portrait of one of Carlo Dolce's daughters
who died young:&mdash;and yet</p>

<p><i>Nov. 15.</i>&mdash;Our stay at Florence promises to be far gayer than either
Milan or Venice, or even Paris; more diversified by society, as well
as affording a wider field of occupation and amusement.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the long evenings, when fatigued and over-excited, I
recline apart on the sofa, or bury myself in the recesses of a <i>fauteuil</i>;
when I am aware that my mind is wandering away to forbidden themes,
I force my attention to what is going forward; and often see and hear
much that is entertaining, if not improving. People are so accustomed
to my pale face, languid indifference and, what M&mdash;&mdash; calls, my <i>impracticable</i>
silence, that after the first glance and introduction, I believe
they are scarcely sensible of my presence: so I sit, and look, and
listen, secure and harboured in my apparent dullness. The flashes of
wit, the attempts at sentiment, the affectation of enthusiasm, the absurdities
of folly, and the blunders of ignorance; the contrast of characters
and the clash of opinions, the scandalous anecdotes of the day,
related with sprightly malice, and listened to with equally malicious
avidity,&mdash;all these, in my days of health and happiness, had power to
surprise, or amuse, or provoke me. I could mingle <i>then</i> in the conflict
of minds; and hear my part with smiles in the social circle;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
though the next moment, perhaps, I might contemn myself and others:
and the personal scandal, the characteristic tale, the amusing folly, or
the malignant wit, were effaced from my mind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"Like forms with chalk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Painted on rich men's floors for one feast night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now it is different: I can smile yet, but my smile is in pity, rather
than in mockery. If suffering has subdued my mind to seriousness,
and perhaps enfeebled its powers, I may at least hope that it has not
soured or imbittered my temper:&mdash;if what could once <i>amuse</i>, no longer
amuses,&mdash;what could once <i>provoke</i> has no longer power to irritate:
thus my loss may be improved into a gain&mdash;<i>car tout est bien, quand
tout est mal</i>.</p>

<p>It is sorrow which makes our experience; it is sorrow which teaches
us to feel properly for ourselves and for others. We must feel deeply,
before we can think rightly. It is not in the tempest and storm of
passions we can reflect,&mdash;but afterwards when <i>the waters have gone
over our soul</i>; and like the precious gems and the rich merchandize
which the wild wave casts on the shore out of the wreck it has made&mdash;such
are the thoughts left by retiring passions.</p>

<p>Reflection is the result of feeling; from that absorbing, heart-rending
compassion for oneself (the most painful sensation, <i>almost</i>,
of which our nature is capable), springs a deeper sympathy for others;
and from the sense of our own weakness, and our own self-upbraiding,
arises a disposition to be indulgent&mdash;to forbear&mdash;and to forgive&mdash;so
at least it ought to be. When once we have shed those inexpressibly
bitter tears, which fall unregarded, and which we forget to wipe away,
O how we shrink from inflicting pain! how we shudder at unkindness!&mdash;and
think all harshness even in thought, only another name for
cruelty! These are but common-place truths, I know, which have
often been a thousand times better expressed. Formerly I heard them,
read them, and thought I believed them: now I feel them; and feeling,
I utter them as if they were something new.&mdash;Alas! the lessons
of sorrow are as old as the world itself.</p>

<p>To-day we have seen nothing new. In the morning I was ill: in
the afternoon we drove to the Cascina; and while the rest walked, I
spread my shawl upon the bank and basked like a lizard in the sunshine.
It was a most lovely day, a summer-day in England. In this paradise
of a country, the common air, and earth, and skies, seem happiness
enough. While I sat to-day, on my green bank&mdash;languid, indeed,
but free from pain&mdash;and looked round upon a scene which has lost its
novelty, but none of its beauty,&mdash;where Florence, with its glittering
domes and its back-ground of sunny hills, terminated my view on one
side, and the Apennines, tinted with rose colour and gold, bounded it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
on the other, I felt not only pleasure, but a deep thankfulness that such
pleasures were yet left to me.</p>

<p>Among the gay figures who passed and repassed before me, I remarked
a benevolent but rather heavy-looking old gentleman, with a
shawl hanging over his arm, and holding a parasol, with which he
was gallantly shading a little plain old woman from the November sun.
After them walked two young ladies, simply dressed; and then followed
a tall and very handsome young man, with a plain but elegant
girl hanging on his arm. This was the Grand Duke and his family;
with the Prince of Carignano, who has lately married one of his
daughters. Two servants in plain drab liveries, followed at a considerable
distance. People politely drew on one side as they approached;
but no other homage was paid to the sovereign, who thus takes his
walk in public almost every day. Lady Morgan is merry at the expense
of the Grand Duke's taste for brick and mortar: but monarchs,
like other men, must have their amusements; some invent uniforms,
some stitch embroidery;&mdash;and why should not this good-natured Grand
Duke amuse himself with his trowel if he likes it? As to the Prince
of Carignano, I give him up to her lash&mdash;<i>le tra&icirc;tre</i>&mdash;but perhaps he
thought he was doing right: and at all events there are not flatterers
wanting, to call his perfidy patriotism.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>I am told that Florence retains its reputation of being the most
devout capital in Italy, and that here love, music, and devotion hold
divided empire, or rather are <i>tria juncta in uno</i>. The liberal patronage
and taste of Lord Burghersh, contribute perhaps to make music
so much a <i>passion</i> as it is at present. Magnelli, the Grand Duke's
Maestra di Cappella, and director of the Conservatorio, is the finest
tenor in Italy. I have the pleasure of hearing him frequently, and
think the purity of his taste at least equal to the perfection of his voice;
rare praise for a singer in these "most brisk and giddy-paced times."
He gave us last night the beautiful recitative which introduces Desdemona's
song in Othello&mdash;</p>

<p>Yesterday we visited the church of San Lorenzo, the Laurentian
library, and the Pietra Dura manufactory, and afterwards spent an
hour in the Tribune.</p>

<p>In a little chapel in the San Lorenzo are Michel Angelo's famous
statues, the Morning, the Noon, the Evening, and the Night. I
looked at them with admiration rather than with pleasure; for there is
something in the severe and overpowering style of this master, which
affects me disagreeably, as beyond my feeling, and above my comprehension.
These statues are very ill disposed for effect: the confined
<i>cell</i> (such it seemed) in which they are placed is so strangely disproportioned
to the awful and massive grandeur of their forms.</p>

<p>There is a picture by Michel Angelo, considered a chef-d'&#339;uvre,
which hangs in the Tribune, to the right of the Venus: now if all the
connaisseurs in the world, with Vasari at their head, were to harangue
for an hour together on the merits of this picture, I might submit in
silence, for I am no connoisseur; but that it is a disagreeable, a hateful
picture, is an opinion which fire could not melt out of me. In spite
of Messieurs les Connaisseurs, and Michel Angelo's fame, I would die
in it at the stake: for instance, here is the Blessed Virgin, not the
"Vergine Santa, d'ogni grazia piena," but a Virgin, whose brick-dust
coloured face, harsh unfeminine features, and muscular, masculine
arms, give me the idea of a washerwoman, (con rispetto parlando!)
an infant Saviour with the proportions of a giant: and what shall we
say of the nudity of the figures in the back-ground; profaning the subject
and shocking at once good taste and good sense? A little farther
on, the eye rests on the divine Madre di Dio of Correggio: what
beauty, what sweetness, what maternal love, and humble adoration are
blended in the look and attitude with which she bends over her infant!
Beyond it hangs the Madonna del Cardellino of Raffaelle: what
heavenly grace, what simplicity, what saint-like purity, in the expression
of that face, and that exquisite mouth! And from these must
I turn back, on pain of being thought an ignoramus, to admire the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
coarse perpetration of Michel Angelo&mdash;because it is Michel Angelo's?
But I speak in ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>To return to San Lorenzo. The chapel of the Medici, begun by
Ferdinand the First, where coarse brickwork and plaster mingle with
marble and gems, is still unfinished and likely to remain so: it did not
interest me. The fine bronze sarcophagus, which encloses the ashes
of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and of his brother Giuliano, assassinated
by the Pazzi, interested me far more. While I was standing carelessly
in front of the high altar, I happened to look down, and under my feet
were these words, "<span class="smcap">To Cosmo The Venerable, the Father of his
Country</span>." I moved away in haste, and before I had decided to my
own satisfaction upon Cosmo's claims to the gratitude and veneration of
posterity, we left the church.</p>

<p>At the Laurentian library we were edified by the sight of some
famous old manuscripts, invaluable to classical scholars. To my unlearned
eyes the manuscript of Petrarch, containing portraits of himself
and Laura, was more interesting. Petrarch is hideous&mdash;but I was
pleased with the head of Laura, which in spite of the antique dryness
and stiffness of the painting, has a soft and delicate expression not unlike
one of Carlo Dolce's Madonnas. Here we saw Galileo's forefinger,
pointing up to the skies from a white marble pedestal; and
exciting more derision than respect.</p>

<p>At the Pietra Dura, notwithstanding the beauty and durability of
some of the objects manufactured, the result seemed to me scarce worth
the incredible time, patience, and labour required in the work. <i>Par
exemple</i>, six months' hard labour spent upon a butterfly in the lid of a
snuff-box seems a most disproportionate waste of time. Thirty
workmen are employed here at the Grand Duke's expense; for this
manufacture, like that of the Gobelins at Paris, is exclusively carried
on for the sovereign.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 20.</i>&mdash;I am struck in this place with grand beginnings and mean
endings. I have not yet seen a finished church, even the Duomo has
no fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

<p>Yesterday we visited the Palazzo Mozzi to see Benvenuto's picture,
"The Night after the Battle of Jena." Then several churches&mdash;the
Santa Croce, which is hallowed ground: the Annonciata, celebrated
for the frescos of Andrea del Sarto; and the Carmine, which pleased
me by the light elegance of its architecture, and its fine alto-relievos in
white marble. In this church is the chapel of the Madonna del Carmele,
painted by Masuccio, and the most ancient frescos extant: they
are curious rather than beautiful, and going to decay.</p>

<p>To-day we visited the school of the Fine Arts: it contains a very fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and ample collection of casts after the antique; and some of the works
of modern artists and students are exhibited. Were I to judge from
the specimens I have seen here and elsewhere, I should say that a cold,
glaring, hard <i>tea-tray</i> style prevails in painting, and a still worse taste,
if possible, in sculpture. No soul, no grandeur, no simplicity; a
meagre insipidity in the conception, a nicety of finish in the detail;
affectation instead of grace, distortion instead of power, and prettiness
instead of beauty. Yet the artists who execute these works, and those
who buy them, have free access to the marvels of the gallery, and the
treasures of the Pitti Palace. Are they sans eyes, sans souls, sans taste,
sans every thing, but money and self-conceit?</p>

<p><i>Nov. 22.</i>&mdash;Our mornings, however otherwise occupied, are generally
concluded by an hour in the gallery or at the Pitti Palace; the
evenings are spent in the Mercato Nuovo, in the workshops of artists,
or at the Cascina.</p>

<p>To-day at the gallery I examined the Dutch school and the Salle des
Portraits, and ended as usual with the Tribune. The Salle des
Portraits contains a complete collection of the portraits of painters down
to the present day. In general their respective countenances are expressive
of their characters and style of painting. Poor Harlow's picture,
painted by himself, is here.</p>

<p>The Dutch and Flemish painters (in spite of their exquisite pots and
pans, and cabbages and carrots, their birch-brooms, in which you can
count every twig, and their carpets, in which you can reckon every
thread) do not interest me; their landscapes too, however natural, are
mere Dutch nature (with some brilliant exceptions), fat cattle, clipped
trees, boors, and windmills. Of course I am not speaking of Vandyke,
nor of Rubens, he that "in the colours of the rainbow lived," nor of
Rembrandt, that king of clouds and shadows; but for mine own part, I
would give up all that Mieris, Netscher, Teniers, and Gerard Douw
ever produced, for one of Claude's Eden-like creations, or one of
Guido's lovely heads&mdash;or merely for the pleasure of looking at Titian's
Flora once a day, I would give a whole gallery of Dutchmen, if I had
them.</p>

<p>In the daughter of Herodias, by Leonardo da Vinci, there is the
same eternal face he always paints, but with a peculiar expression&mdash;she
turns away her head with the air of a fine lady, whose senses are
shocked by the sight of blood and death, while her heart remains untouched
either by remorse or pity.</p>

<p>His ghastly Medusa made me shudder while it fascinated me, as if
in those loathsome snakes, writhing and glittering round the expiring
head, and those abhorred and fiendish abominations crawling into life,
there still lurked the fabled spell which petrified the beholder. Poor
Medusa! was this the guerdon of thy love? and were those the tresses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which enslaved the ocean's lord? Methinks that in this wild mythological
fiction, in the terrific vengeance which Minerva takes for her
profaned temple, and in the undying snakes which for ever hiss round
the head of her victim&mdash;there is a deep moral, if woman would lay it
to her heart.</p>

<p>In Guercino's Endymion, the very mouth is asleep: in his Sybil the
very eyes are prophetic, and glance into futurity.</p>

<p>The boyish, but divine St. John, by Raffaelle, did not please me so
well as some of his portraits and Madonnas; his Leo the Tenth, for
instance, his Julius the Second, or even his Fornarina: and I may observe
here, that I admire Titian's taste much more than Raffaelle's, <i>en
fait de <a name="maitresse44" id="maitresse44"></a>ma&icirc;tresse</i>. The Fornarina is a mere <i>femme du peuple</i>, a coarse
virago, compared to the refined, the exquisite La Manto, in the Pitti
Palace. I think the Flora must have been painted from the same
lovely model, as far as I can judge from compared recollections, for I
have no authority to refer to. The former is the most elegant, and the
latter the most poetical female portrait I ever saw. At Titian's Venus
in the Tribune, one hardly ventures to look up; it is the perfection of
earthly loveliness, as the Venus de' Medici is all ideal&mdash;all celestial
beauty. In the multiplied copies and engravings of this picture I see
every where the bashful sweetness of the countenance, and the tender
languid repose of the figure are made coarse, or something worse: degraded,
in short, into a character altogether unlike the original.</p>

<p>I say nothing of the Gallery of the Palazzo Pitti; which is not a
collection so much as a <i>selection</i> of the most invaluable gems and masterpieces
of art. The imagination dazzled and bewildered by excellence
can scarcely make a choice&mdash;but I think the Madonna Della
Seggiola of Raffaelle, Allori's magnificent Judith, Guido's Cleopatra,
and Salvator's Catiline, dwell most upon my memory.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Nov. 24.</i>&mdash;After dinner, we drove to the beautiful gardens of the
Villa Strozzi, on the Monte Ulivetto, and the evening we spent at the
Cocomero, where we saw a detestable opera, capitally acted, and heard
the most vile, noisy, unmeaning music, sung to perfection.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 26.</i>&mdash;Yesterday we spent some hours at Morghen's gallery,
looking over his engravings; and afterwards examined the bronze
gates of the Baptistery, which Michel Angelo used to call the gates of
Paradise. We then ascended the Campanile or Belfry Tower to see
the view from its summit. Florence lay at our feet, diminished to a
model of itself, with its walls and gates, its streets and bridges, palaces
and churches, all and each distinctly visible; and beyond, the Val
d'Arno with its amphitheatre of hills, its villas, and its vineyards&mdash;classical
Fesole, with its ruined castle, and Monte Ulivetto, with its
diadem of cypresses; luxuriant nature and graceful art, blending into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
one glorious picture, which no smoky vapours, no damp exhalations,
blotted and discoloured; but all was serenely bright and fair, gay
with moving life, and rich with redundant fertility.</p>

<p><i>28.</i>&mdash;"Corinne" I find is a fashionable <i>vade mecum</i> for sentimental
travellers in Italy; and that I too might be <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, I brought
it from Molini's to-day, with the intention of reading on the spot,
those admirable and affecting passages which relate to Florence; but
when I began to cut the leaves, a kind of terror seized me, and I
threw it down, resolved not to open it again. I know myself weak&mdash;I
feel myself unhappy; and to find my own feelings reflected from
the pages of a book, in language too deeply and eloquently true, is
not good for me. I want no helps to admiration, nor need I kindle
my enthusiasm at the torch of another's mind. I can suffer enough,
feel enough, think enough, without this.</p>

<p>Not being well, I spent a long morning at home, and then strayed
into the church of the Santo Spirito, which is near our hotel. There
is in this church a fine copy of Michel Angelo's Piet&agrave;, which a monk,
whom I met in the church, insisted was the original. But I believe
the <i>originalissimo</i> group is at Rome. There are also two fine pictures,
a marriage of the Virgin, in a very sweet Guido-like style,
and the woman taken in adultery. This church is the richest in paintings
I have seen here. I remarked a picture of the Virgin said to
be possessed of miraculous powers; and that part of it visible, is not
destitute of merit as a painting; but some of her grateful devotees,
having decorated her with a real blue silk gown, spangled with tinsel
stars, and two or three crowns, one above another, of gilt foil, the
effect is the oddest imaginable. As I was sitting upon a marble step,
philosophizing to myself, and wondering at what seemed to me such
senseless bad taste, such pitiable and ridiculous superstition, there
came up a poor woman leading by the hand a pale and delicate boy,
about four years old. She prostrated herself before the picture, while
the child knelt beside her, and prayed for some time with fervour;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
she then lifted him up, and the mother and child kissed the picture
alternately with great devotion; then making him kneel down and
clasp his little hands, she began to teach him an Ave Maria, repeating
it word for word, slowly and distinctly, so that I got it by heart too.
Having finished their devotions, the mother put into the child's hands
a piece of money, which she directed him to drop into a box, inscribed,
"per i poveri vergognosi"&mdash;"for the bashful poor;" they then
went their way. I was an unperceived witness of this little scene,
which strongly affected me: the simple piety of this poor woman,
though mistaken in its object, appeared to me respectable; and the
Virgin, in her sky-blue brocade and her gilt tiara, no longer an object
to ridicule. I returned home rejoicing in kinder, gentler, happier
thoughts; for though I may wish these poor people a purer worship,
yet, as Wordsworth says somewhere, far better than I could express
it&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Attended divine service at the English ambassador's, in
the morning, and in the evening, not being well enough to go to the
Cascine, I remained at home. I sat down at the window and read
Foscolo's beautiful poem, "I sepoleri:" the subject of my book, and
the sight of Alfieri's house meeting my eye whenever I looked up,
inspired the idea of visiting the Santa Croce again, and I ventured out
unattended. The streets, and particularly the Lung' Arno, were
crowded with gay people in their holiday costumes. Not even our
Hyde Park, on a summer Sunday, ever presented a more lively
spectacle or a better dressed mob. I was often tempted to turn back
rather than encounter this moving multitude; but at length I found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
my way to the Santa Croce, which presented a very different scene.
The service was over; and a few persons were walking up and down
the aisles, or kneeling at different altars. In a chapel on the other
side of the cloisters, they were chanting the Via Crucis; and the blended
voices swelled and floated round, then died away, then rose again,
and at length sunk into silence. The evening was closing fast, the
shadows of the heavy pillars grew darker and darker, the tapers round
the high altar twinkled in the distance like dots of light, and the
tombs of Michel Angelo, of Galileo, of Machiavelli, and Alfieri, were
projected from the deep shadow in indistinct formless masses: but I
needed not to see them to image them before me; for with each and
all my fancy was familiar. I spent about an hour walking up and
down&mdash;abandoned to thoughts which were melancholy, but not bitter.
All memory, all feeling, all grief, all pain were swallowed up in the
sublime tranquillity which was within me and around me. How
could I think of myself, and of the sorrow which swells at my impatient
heart, while all of genius that could die, was sleeping round
me; and the spirits of the glorious dead&mdash;they who rose above their
fellow men by the might of intellect&mdash;whose aim was excellence, the
noble end "that made ambition virtue," were, or seemed to me,
present?&mdash;and if those tombs could have opened their ponderous and
marble jaws, what histories of sufferings and persecution, wrongs and
wretchedness, might they not reveal! Galileo&mdash;</p>

<p>But they fulfilled their destinies: inexorable Fate will be avenged
upon the favourites of Heaven and nature. I can remember but one
instance in which the greatly gifted spirit was not also the conspicuously
wretched mortal&mdash;our own divine Shakspeare&mdash;and of him we
know but little.</p>

<p>In some books of travels I have met with, Boccaccio, Aretino, and
Guicciardini, are mentioned among the illustrious dead of the Santa
Croce. The second, if his biographers say true, was a wretch, whose
ashes ought to have been scattered in the air. He was buried I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>believe
at Venice&mdash;or no matter where. Boccaccio's tomb <i>is</i>, or <i>was</i>,
at Certaldo; and Guicciardini's&mdash;I forget the name of the church honoured
by his remains&mdash;but it is not the Santa Croce.</p>

<p>The finest figure on the tomb of Michel Angelo is architecture. It
should be contemplated from the left, to be seen to advantage. The
effect of Alfieri's monument depends much on the position of the spectator:
when viewed in front, the figure of Italy is very heavy and
clumsy; and in no point of view has it the grace and delicacy which
Canova's statues generally possess.</p>

<p>There is a most extraordinary picture in this church representing
God the Father supporting a dead Christ, by Cigoli, a painter little
known in England, though I have seen some admirable pictures of his
in the collections here: his style reminds me of Spagnoletto's.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Our departure is fixed for Wednesday next: and though I know
that change and motion are good for me, yet I dread the fatigue and
excitement of travelling; and I shall leave Florence with regret. For
a melancholy invalid like myself, there cannot be a more delightful
residence: it is gay without tumult&mdash;quiet, yet not dull. I have not
mingled in society; therefore cannot judge of the manners of the
people. I trust they are not exactly what Forsyth describes: with all
his taste he sometimes writes like a caustic old bachelor; and on the
Florentines he is peculiarly severe.</p>

<p>We leave our friend L. behind for a few days, and our Venice acquaintance
V. will be our <i>compagnon de voyage</i> to Rome. Of these
two young men, the first amuses me by his follies, the latter rather
fatigues <i>de trop de raison</i>. The first talks too much, the latter too
little: the first speaks, and speaks egregious nonsense; the latter
never says any thing beyond common-place: the former always makes
himself ridiculous, and the latter never makes himself particularly
agreeable: the first is (<i>con rispetto parlando</i>) a great fool, and the
latter would be pleasanter were he less wise. Between these two
<i>opposites</i>, I was standing this evening on the banks of the Arno, contemplating
a sunset of unequalled splendour. L. finding that enthusiasm
was his cue, played off various sentimental antics, peeped through
his fingers, threw his head on one side, exclaiming, "Magnificent, by
Jove! grand! grandissimo! It just reminds me of what Shakspeare
says: 'Fair Aurora'&mdash;I forget the rest."</p>

<p>V. with his hands in his pockets, contemplated the superb spectacle&mdash;the
mountains, the valley, the city flooded with a crimson glory,
and the river flowing at our feet like molten gold&mdash;he gazed on it all
with a look of placid satisfaction, and then broke out&mdash;"Well! this
does one's heart good!"</p>

<p>L. (I owe him this justice) is not the author of the famous blunder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
which is now repeated in every circle. I am assured it was our
neighbour, Lord G. though I scarce believe it, who on being presented
with the Countess of Albany's card, exclaimed&mdash;"The Countess
of Albany! Ah!&mdash;true&mdash;I remember: wasn't she the widow of
Charles the Second, who married Ariosto?" There is in this celebrated
<i>beveu</i>, a glorious confusion of times and persons, beyond even
my friend L.'s capacity.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>The whole party are gone to the Countess of Albany's to-night to
take leave: that being, as L. says, "the correct thing." Our notions
of correctness vary with country and climate. What Englishwoman
at Florence would not be <i>au d&eacute;sespoir</i>, to be shut from the Countess
of Albany's parties&mdash;though it is a known and indisputable fact, that
she was never married to Alfieri? A propos d'Alfieri&mdash;I have just
been reading a selection of his tragedies&mdash;his Filippo, the Pazzi, Virginia,
Mirra; and when I have finished Saul, I will read no more of
them for some time. There is a superabundance of harsh energy, and
a want of simplicity, tenderness, and repose throughout, which
fatigues me, until admiration becomes an effort instead of a pleasurable
feeling. Marochesi, a celebrated tragedian, who, Minutti says,
understood "<i>la vera filosofia della comica</i>," used to recite Alfieri's
tragedies with him or to him. Alfieri was himself a bad actor and
declaimer. I am surprised that the tragedy of Mirra should be a
great favourite on the stage here. A very young actress, who made
her deb&ucirc;t in this character, enchanted the whole city by the admirable
manner in which she performed it; and the piece was played
for eighteen nights successively; a singular triumph for an actress,
though not uncommon for a singer. In spite of its many beauties
and the artful management of the story; it would, I think, be as impossible
to make an English audience endure the Mirra, as to find an
English actress who would exhibit herself in so revolting a part.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Our last day at Florence. I walked down to the San
Lorenzo this morning early, and made a sketch of the sarcophagus of
Lorenzo de' Medici. Afterwards we spent an hour in the gallery, and
bid adieu to the Venus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O bella Venere!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Che sola sei,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piacer degli uomini<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E degli dei!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When I went to take a last look of Titian's Flora, I found it removed
from its station, and an artist employed in copying it. I could have
envied the lady for whom this copy was intended; but comforted myself
with the conviction that no hireling dauber in water-colours could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
do justice to the heavenly original, which only wants motion and speech
to live indeed. We then spent nearly two hours in the Pitti Palace;
and the court having lately removed to Pisa, we had an opportunity of
seeing Canova's Venus, which is placed in one of the Grand Duke's
private apartments. She stands in the centre of a small cabinet, pannelled
with mirrors, which reflect her at once in every possible point
of view. This statue was placed on the pedestal of the Venus de' Medicis
during her forced residence at Paris; and is justly considered as
the triumph of modern art: but though a most beautiful creature, she
is not a goddess. I looked in vain for that full divinity, that ethereal
<i>something</i> which breathes round the Venus of the Tribune. In another
private room are two magnificent landscapes by Salvator Rosa.</p>

<p>Every good catholic has a portrait of the Virgin hung at the head of
his bed; partly as an object of devotion, and partly to scare away the
powers of evil: and for this purpose the Grand Duke has suspended
by his bed-side one of the most beautiful of Raffaelle's <a name="Madonnas" id="Madonnas"></a>Madonnas. Truly,
I admire the good taste of his piety, though it is rather selfish thus to
appropriate such a gem, when the merest daub would answer the same
purpose. It was only by secret bribery I obtained a peep at this picture,
as the room is not publicly shown.</p>

<p>The lower classes at Florence are in general ill-looking; nor have
I seen one handsome woman since I came here. Their costume too
is singularly unbecoming; but there is an airy cheerfulness and vivacity
in their countenances, and a civility in their manners which is
pleasing to a stranger. I was surprised to see the women, even the
servant girls, decorated with necklaces of real pearl of considerable
beauty and value. On expressing my surprise at this to a shopkeeper's
wife, she informed me that these necklaces are handed down as a kind
of heir-loom from mother to daughter; and a young woman is considered
as dowered who possesses a handsome chain of pearl. If she has
no hope of one in reversion, she buys out of her little earnings a pearl
at a time, till she has completed a necklace.</p>

<p>The style of swearing at Florence is peculiarly elegant and classical;
I hear the vagabonds in the street adjuring Venus and Bacchus; and
my shoemaker swore "by the aspect of Diana," that he would not
take less than ten pauls for what was worth about three;&mdash;yet was the
knave forsworn.</p>

<p><i>December 8.</i>&mdash;In beginning another volume, I feel almost inclined
to throw the last into the fire; as in writing it I have generally begun
the record of one day by tearing away the half of what was written
the day before: but though it contains much that I would rather forget,
and some things written under the impression of pain, and sick and
irritable feelings, I will not yet <i>ungratefully</i> destroy it. I have frequently
owed to my little Diary not amusement only, but consolation.
It has gradually become not only the faithful depository of my recollections,
but the confidante of my feelings, and the sole witness of my
tears. I know not if this be wise: but if it be folly, I have the comfort
of knowing that a mere act of my will destroys for ever the record
of my weakness; and meantime a confidante whose mouth is sealed
with a patent lock and key, and whom I can put out of existence in a
single moment, is not dangerous; so, as Lord Byron elegantly expresses
it, "<i>Here goes</i>."</p>

<p>We left Florence this morning; and saw the sun rise upon a country
so enchantingly beautiful, that I dare not trust myself to description;
but I felt it, and still feel it&mdash;almost in my heart. The blue cloudless
sky, the sun pouring his beams upon a land, which even in this wintry
season smiles when others languish&mdash;the soft varied character of the
scenery, comprising every species of natural beauty&mdash;the green slope,
the woody hill, the sheltered valley,&mdash;the deep dales, into which we
could just peep, as the carriage whirled us too rapidly by&mdash;the rugged
fantastic rocks, cultivated plains, and sparkling rivers, and, beyond all,
the chain of the <a name="Apennines" id="Apennines"></a>Apennines with light clouds floating across them, or
resting in their recesses&mdash;all this I saw, and felt, and shall not forget.</p>

<p>I write this at Arezzo, the birth-place of Petrarch, of Redi, of Pignotti,
and of that Guido who discovered Counter-point. Whether
Arezzo is remarkable for any thing else, I am too sleepy to recollect:
and as we depart early to-morrow morning, it would only tantalize me
to remember. We arrived here late, by the light of a most resplendent
moon. If such is this country in winter, what must it be in
summer?</p>

<p><i>9th, at Perugia.</i>&mdash;All the beauties of natural scenery have been
combined with historical associations, to render our journey of to-day
most interesting; and with a mind more at ease, nothing has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
wanting to render this one of the most delightful days I have spent
abroad.</p>

<p>At Cortona, Hannibal slept the night before the battle of Thrasymene.
Soon after leaving this town on our left, we came in view of the lake,
and the old tower on its banks. There is an ancient ruin on a high
eminence to the left, which our postilion called the "Forteressa di
Annibale il Carthago." Further on, the Gualandra hills seem to circle
round the lake; and here was the scene of the battle. The channel of
the Sanguinetto, which then ran red with the best blood of Rome and
Carthage, was dry when we crossed it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And hooting boys might dry-shod pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gather pebbles from the naked ford."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While we traversed the field of battle at a slow pace, V. who had his
Livy in his pocket, read aloud his minute description of the engagement;
and we could immediately point out the different places mentioned
by the historian. The whole valley and the hills around are
now covered with olive woods; and from an olive tree which grew
close to the edge of the lake, I snatched a branch as we passed by, and
shall preserve it&mdash;an emblem of peace, from the theatre of slaughter.
The whole landscape as we looked back upon it from a hill on this side
of the Casa del Rano, was exceedingly beautiful. The lake seemed to
slumber in the sunshine; and Passignano jutting into the water, with
its castellated buildings, the two little woody islands, and the undulating
hills enclosing the whole, as if to shut it from the world, made it
look like a scene fit only to be peopled by fancy's fairest <a name="creations" id="creations"></a>creations, if
the remembrance of its blood-stained glories had not started up, to rob
it of half its beauty. Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash; compared it to the lake of Geneva;
but in my own mind, I would not admit the comparison. The lake of
Geneva stands alone in its beauty; for there the sublimest and the
softest features of nature are united: there the wonderful, the wild, and
the beautiful, blend in one mighty scene; and love and heroism, poetry
and genius, have combined to hallow its shores. The lake of Perugia
is far more circumscribed: the scenery around it wants grandeur and
extent; though so beautiful in itself, that if no comparison had been
made, no want would have been suggested: and on the bloody field
of Thrasymene I looked with curiosity and interest unmingled with
pleasure. I have long survived my sympathy with the fighting heroes
of antiquity. All this I thought as we slowly walked up the hill, but
I was silent as usual: as Jaques says, "I can think of as many
matters as other men, but I praise God, and make no boast of it." We
arrived here too late to see any thing of the city.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 10th, at Terni.</i>&mdash;The ridiculous <i>contre-temps</i> we sometimes
meet with would be matter of amusement to me, if they did not affect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
others. And in truth, as far as paying well, and scolding well, can
go, it is impossible to travel more magnificently, more <i>&agrave; la milor
Anglais</i> than we do: but there is no controlling fate; and here, as
our evil destinies will have it, a company of strolling actors had taken
possession of the best quarters before our arrival; and our accommodations
are, I must confess, tolerably bad.</p>

<p>When we left Perugia this morning, the city, throned upon its lofty
eminence, with its craggy rocks, its tremendous fortifications, and its
massy gateways, had an imposing effect. Forwards, we looked over
a valley, which so resembled a lake, the hills projecting above the glittering
white vapour having the appearance of islands scattered over
its surface, that at the first glance I was positively deceived; and all
my topographical knowledge, which I had conned on the map the night
before, completely put to the rout. As the day advanced, this white
mist sank gradually to the earth, like a veil dropped from the form of
a beautiful woman, and nature stood disclosed in all her loveliness.</p>

<p>Trevi, on its steep and craggy hill, detached from the chain of
mountains, looked beautiful as we gazed up at it, with its buildings
mingled with rocks and olives&mdash;</p>

<p>I had written thus far, when we were all obliged to decamp in
haste to our respective bed-rooms; as it is found necessary to convert
our salon into a dormitory. I know I shall be tired, and very tired
to-morrow,&mdash;therefore add a few words in pencil, before the impressions
now fresh on my mind are obscured.</p>

<p>After Trevi came the Clitumnus with its little fairy temple; and
we left the carriage to view it from below, and drink of the classic
stream. The temple (now a chapel) is not much in itself, and was voted
in bad taste by some of our party. To me the tiny fane, the glassy
river, more pure and limpid than any fabled or famous fountain of
old, the beautiful hills, the sunshine, and the associations connected
with the whole scene, were enchanting; and I could not at the moment
descend to architectural criticism.</p>

<p>The road to Spoleto was a succession of olive grounds, vineyards,
and rich woods. The vines with their skeleton boughs looked wintry
and miserable; but the olives, now in full fruit and foliage, intermixed
with the cypress, the ilex, the cork tree, and the pine, clothed the
landscape with a many-tinted robe of verdure.</p>

<p>While sitting in the open carriage at Spoleto, waiting for horses, I
saw one of that magnificent breed of "milk white steers," for which
the banks of the Clitumnus have been famed from all antiquity, led
past me gaily decorated, to be baited on a plain without the city. As
the noble creature, serene and unresisting, paced along, followed by a
wild, ferocious-looking, and far more brutal rabble, I would have
given all I possessed to redeem him from his tormentors: but it was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
vain. As we left the city, we heard his tremendous roar of agony and
rage echo from the rocks. I stopped my ears, and was glad when we
were whirled out of hearing. The impression left upon my nerves by
this rencontre, makes me dislike to remember Spoleto: yet I believe
it is a beautiful and interesting place. Hannibal, as I recollect, besieged
this city, but was bravely repulsed. I could say much more of
the scenes and the feelings of to-day; but my pencil refuses to mark
another letter.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Dec. 11th, at Civita Castellana.</i>&mdash;I could not write a word to-night
in the salon, because I wished to listen to the conversation of two intelligent
travellers, who, arriving after us, were obliged to occupy the
same apartment. Our accommodations here are indeed deplorable
altogether. After studying the geography of my bed, and finding no
spot thereon, to which Sancho's couch of pack-saddles and pummels
would not be a bed of down in comparison, I ordered a fresh faggot on
my hearth: they brought me some ink in a gally-pot&mdash;<i>invisible</i> ink&mdash;for
I cannot see what I am writing; and I sit down to scribble,
<i>pour me d&eacute;sennuyer</i>.</p>

<p>This morning we set off to visit the Falls of Terni (la cascata di
Marmore) in two carriages and four: O such equipages!&mdash;such ratlike
steeds! such picturesque accoutrements! and such poetical looking
guides and postilions, ragged, cloaked, and whiskered!&mdash;but it
was all consistent: the wild figures harmonized with the wild landscape.
We passed a singular fortress on the top of a steep insulated
rock, which had formerly been inhabited by a band of robbers and
their families, who were with great difficulty, and after a regular
siege, dislodged by a party of soldiers, and the place dismantled. In
its present ruined state, it has a very picturesque effect; and though
the presence of the banditti would no doubt have added greatly to the
romance of the scene, on the present occasion we excused their
absence.</p>

<p>We visited the falls both above and below, but unfortunately we neither
saw them from the best point of view, nor at the best season.
The body of waters is sometimes ten times greater, as I was assured&mdash;but
can scarce believe it possible. The words "Hell of waters,"
used by Lord Byron, would not have occurred to me while looking at
this cataract, which impresses the astonished mind with an overwhelming
idea of power, might, magnificence, and impetuosity; but blends
at the same time all that is most tremendous in sound and motion, with
all that is most bright and lovely in forms, in colours, and in
scenery.</p>

<p>As I stood close to the edge of the precipice, immediately under the
great fall, I felt my respiration gone: I turned giddy, almost faint, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was obliged to lean against the rock for support. The mad plunge of
the waters, the deafening roar, the presence of a power which no
earthly force could resist or control, struck me with an awe almost
amounting to terror. A bright sunbow stood over the torrent, which,
seen from below, has the appearance of a luminous white arch bending
from rock to rock. The whole scene was&mdash;but how can I say what
it was? I have exhausted my stock of fine words; and must be content
with silent recollections, and the sense of admiration and wonder
unexpressed.</p>

<p>Below the fall, an inundation which took place a year ago, undermined
and carried away part of the banks of the Nera, at the same time
laying open an ancient Roman bridge, which had been buried for ages.
The channel of the river and the depth of the soil must have been
greatly altered since this bridge was erected.</p>

<p>When we returned to the inn at Terni, and while the horses were
putting to, I took up a volume of Eustace's tour, which some traveller
had accidentally left on the table; and turning to the description of
Terni, read part of it, but quickly threw down the book with indignation,
deeming all his verbiage the merest nonsense I had ever met
with: in fact, it <i>is</i> nonsense to attempt to image in words an individual
scene like this. When we had made out our description as accurately
as possible, it would do as well for any other cataract in the world:
we can only combine rocks, wood, and water, in certain proportions.
A good picture may give a tolerable idea of a particular scene or landscape:
but no picture, no painter, not Ruysdael himself, can give a
just idea of a cataract. The lifeless, silent, unmoving image is there:
but where is the thundering roar, the terrible velocity, the glory of
refracted light, the eternity of sound, and infinity of motion, in which
essentially its effect consists?</p>

<p>In the valley beneath the Falls of Terni, there is a beautiful retired
little villa, which was once occupied by the late Queen Caroline: and
in the gardens adjoining it, we gathered oranges from the trees ourselves
for the first time. After passing Mount Soracte, of classical fame,
we took leave of the Apennines; having lived amongst them ever since
we left Bologna.</p>

<p>The costume of this part of the country is very gay and picturesque:
the women wear a white head-dress formed of a square kerchief, which
hangs down upon the shoulders, and is attached to the hair by a silver
pin: a boddice half laced, and decorated with knots of ribbon, and a
short scarlet petticoat complete their attire. Between Perugia and
Terni I did not see one woman without a coral necklace; and those
who have the power, load themselves with trinkets and ornaments.</p>

<p><i>Rome, December 12.</i>&mdash;The morning broke upon us so beautifully
between Civita Castellana and Nevi, that we lauded our good fortune,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and anticipated a glorious approach to the "Eternal City." We were
impatient to reach the heights of Baccano; from which, at the distance
of fifteen miles, we were to view the cross of St. Peter's glittering on
the horizon, while the postilions rising in their stirrups, should point
forward with exultation, and exclaim "<span class="smcap">Roma!</span>" But, O vain hope!
who can controul their fate? just before we reached Baccano, impenetrable
clouds enveloped the whole Campagna. The mist dissolved
into a drizzling rain; and when we entered the city, it poured in torrents.
Since we left England, this is only the third time it has rained
while we were on the road; it seems therefore unconscionable to murmur.
But to lose the first view of Rome! the first view of the dome
of St. Peter's! no&mdash;that lost moment will never be retrieved through
our whole existence.</p>

<p>We found it difficult to obtain suitable accommodation for our numerous
<i>cort&egrave;ge</i>, the Hotel d'Europe, and the Hotel de Londres being
quite full: and for the present we are rather indifferently lodged in the
Albergo di Parigi.</p>

<p>So here we are, in <span class="smcap">Rome</span>! where we have been for the last five
hours, and have not seen an inch of the city beyond the dirty pavement
of the Via Santa Croce; where an excellent dinner cooked <i>&agrave;
l'Anglaise</i>, a blazing fire, a drawing-room <a name="snugly" id="snugly"></a>snugly carpeted and curtained,
and the rain beating against our windows, would almost persuade
us that we are in London; and every now and then, it is with
a kind of surprise that I remind myself that I am really in Rome.
Heaven send us but a fine day to-morrow!</p>

<p><i>13.</i>&mdash;The day arose as beautiful, as brilliant, as cloudless, as I could
have desired for the first day in Rome. About seven o'clock, and before
any one was ready for breakfast, I walked out; and directing my steps
by mere chance to the left, found myself in the Piazza di Spagna and
opposite to a gigantic flight of marble stairs leading to the top of a hill.
I was at the summit in a moment; and breathless and agitated by a
thousand feelings, I leaned against the obelisk, and looked over the
whole city. I knew not where I was: nor among the crowded mass
of buildings, the innumerable domes and towers, and vanes and pinnacles,
brightened by the ascending sun, could I for a while distinguish
a single known object; for my eyes and my heart were both too full:
but in a few minutes my powers of perception returned; and in the
huge round bulk of the castle of St. Angelo, and the immense fa&ccedil;ade
and soaring cupola of St. Peter's, I knew I could not be mistaken. I
gazed and gazed as if I would have drunk it all in at my eyes: and then
descending the superb flight of steps rather more leisurely than I had
ascended, I was in a moment at the door of our hotel.</p>

<p>The rest of the day I wish I could forget&mdash;I found letters from
England on the breakfast table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Until dinner time were we driving through the narrow dirty streets
at the mercy of a stupid <i>laquais de place</i>, in search of better accommodations,
but without success: and, on the whole, I fear I shall
always remember too well the disagreeable and painful impressions of
my first day in Rome.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 18.</i>&mdash;A week has now elapsed, and I begin to know and feel
Rome a little better than I did. The sites of the various buildings, the
situations of the most interesting objects, and the bearings of the principal
hills, the Capitol, the Palatine, the Aventine, and the &AElig;squiline,
have become familiar to me, assisted in my perambulations by an excellent
plan. I have been disappointed in nothing, for I expected that
the general <a name="appearance" id="appearance"></a>appearance of modern Rome would be mean; and that
the impression made by the ancient city would be melancholy; and
I had been, unfortunately, too well prepared, by previous reading,
for all I see, to be astonished by any thing except the Museum of the
Vatican.</p>

<p>I entered St. Peter's expecting to be struck dumb with admiration,
and accordingly it was so. A feeling of vastness filled my whole mind,
and made it disagreeable, almost impossible to speak or exclaim: but
it was a style of grandeur, exciting rather than oppressive to the imagination,
nor did I experience any thing like that sombre and reverential
awe, I have felt on entering one of our Gothic minsters. The
interior of St. Peter's is all airy magnificence, and gigantic splendour;
light and sunshine pouring in on every side; gilding and gay colours,
marbles and pictures, dazzling the eye above, below, around. The
effect of the whole has not diminished in a second and third visit;
but <a name="rather" id="rather"></a>rather grows upon me. I can never utter a word for the first
ten minutes after I enter the church.</p>

<p>For the Museum of the Vatican, I confess I was totally unprepared;
and the first and second time I walked through the galleries, I was so
amazed&mdash;so intoxicated, that I could not fix my attention upon any
individual object, except the Apollo, upon which, as I walked along
confused and lost in wonder and enchantment, I stumbled accidentally,
and stood spell-bound. Gallery beyond gallery, hall within
hall, temple within temple, new splendours opening at every step! of
all the creations of luxurious art, the Museum of the Vatican may alone
defy any description to do it justice, or any fancy to conceive the unimaginable
variety of its treasures. When I remember that the French
had the audacious and sacrilegious vanity to snatch from these glorious sanctuaries
the finest specimens of art, and hide them in their
villanous old gloomy Louvre, I am confounded.</p>

<p>I have been told and can well believe, that the whole <i>giro</i> of the
galleries exceed two miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>I have not yet studied the frescos of Raffaelle sufficiently to feel
all their perfection; and should be in despair at my own dullness, were
I not consoled by the recollection of Sir Joshua Reynolds. At present
one of Raffaelle's divine Virgins delights me more than all his camere
and logie together; but I can look upon them with due veneration,
and grieve to see the ravages of time and damp.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>19.</i>&mdash;Last night we took advantage of a brilliant full moon to visit
the Coliseum by moonlight; and if I came away disappointed of the
pleasure I had expected, the fault was not in me nor in the scene
around me. In its sublime and heart-stirring beauty, it more than
equalled, it surpassed all I had anticipated&mdash;but&mdash;(there must always
be a <i>but!</i> always in the realities of this world something to disgust;)
it happened that one or two gentlemen joined our party&mdash;young men
too, and classical scholars, who perhaps thought it fine to affect a well-bred
<i>nonchalance</i>, a fashionable disdain for all romance and enthusiasm,
and amused themselves with <i>quizzing</i> our guide, insulting the
gloom, the grandeur, and the silence around them, with loud impertinent
laughter at their own poor jokes; and I was obliged to listen,
sad and disgusted, to their empty and tasteless and misplaced flippancy.
The young barefooted friar, with his dark lanthorn, and his black eyes
flashing from under his cowl, who acted as our cicerone, was in picturesque
unison with the scene; but&mdash;more than one murder having
lately been committed among the labyrinthine recesses of the ruin, the
government has given orders that every person entering after dusk
should be attended by a guard of two soldiers. These fellows therefore
necessarily walked close after our heels, smoking, spitting, and
spluttering German. Such were my companions, and such was my
<i>cort&egrave;ge</i>. I returned home vowing that while I remained at Rome,
nothing should induce me to visit the Coliseum by moonlight again.</p>

<p>To-day I was standing before the Laocoon with Rogers, who remarked
that the absence of all parental feeling in the aspect of Laocoon,
his self-engrossed indifference to the sufferings of his children (which
is noticed and censured, I think, by Dr. Moore) adds to the pathos, if
properly considered, by giving the strongest possible idea of that physical
agony which the sculptor intended to represent. It may be so, and
I thought there was both truth and <i>tacte</i> in the poet's observation.</p>

<p>The Perseus of Canova does not please me so well as his Paris; there
is more simplicity and repose in the latter statue, less of that theatrical
air which I think is the common fault of Canova's figures.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary to look at the Perseus before you look at
the Apollo, in order to do the former justice. I have gazed with admiration
at the Perseus for minutes together, then walked from it to the Apollo
and felt instantaneously, but could not have expressed, the difference.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
The first is indeed a beautiful statue, the latter "breathes the flame
with which 'twas wrought," as if the sculptor had left a portion of his
own soul within the marble to half animate his glorious creation. The
want of this informing life is strongly felt in the Perseus, when contemplated
after the Apollo. It is delightful when the imagination rises
in the scale of admiration, when we ascend from excellence to perfection:
but excellence after perfection is absolute inferiority; it sinks
below itself, and the descent is so disagreeable and disappointing, that
we can seldom estimate justly the object before us. We make comparisons
involuntarily in a case where comparisons are odious.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>The weather is cold here during the prevalence of the tramontana:
but I enjoy the brilliant skies and the delicious purity of the air, which
leaves the eye free to wander over a vast extent of space. Looking from
the gallery of the Belvedere at sunset this evening, I clearly saw Tivoli,
Albano, and Frascati, although all Rome and part of the Campagna lay
between me and those towns. The outlines of every building, ruin,
hill, and wood were so distinctly marked, and <i>stood out</i> so brightly to
the eye! and the full round moon, magnified through the purple
vapour which floated over the <a name="Apennines59" id="Apennines59"></a>Apennines, rose just over Tivoli, adding
to the beauty of the scene. O Italy! how I wish I could transport
hither all I love! how I wish I were well enough, happy enough, to
enjoy all the lovely things I see! but pain is mingled with all I behold,
all I feel: a cloud seems for ever before my eyes, a weight for ever
presses down my heart. I know it is wrong to repine: and that I
ought rather to be thankful for the pleasurable sensations yet spared to me,
than lament that they are so few. When I take up my pen to record
the impressions of the day, I sometimes turn within myself, and wonder
how it is possible that amid the strife of feelings not all subdued,
and the desponding of the heart, the mind should still retain its faculties
unobscured, and the imagination all its vivacity and its susceptibility
to pleasure,&mdash;like the beautiful sunbow I saw at the Falls of
Terni, bending so bright and so calm over the verge of the abyss which
toiled and raged below.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>22.</i>&mdash;This morning was devoted to the Capitol, where the objects
of art are ill arranged and too crowded: the lights are not well managed,
and on the whole I could not help wishing, in spite of my
veneration for the Capitol, that some at least among the divine
master-pieces it contains could be transferred to the glorious halls of the
Vatican, and shrined in temples worthy of them.</p>

<p>The objects which most struck me were the dying Gladiator, the
Antinous, the Flora, and the statue called (I know not on what
authority) the Faun of Praxiteles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The dying Gladiator is the chief boast of the Capitol. The antiquarian
Nibby insists that this statue represents a Gaul, that the sculpture
is Grecian, that it formed part of a group on a pediment, representing
the vengeance which Apollo took on the Gauls, when, under their
king Brennus, they attacked the temple of Delphi: that the cord round
the neck is a twisted chain, an ornament peculiar to the Gauls; and
that the form of the shield, the bugles, the style of the hair, and the
mustachios, all prove it to be a Gaul. I asked, "why should such
faultless, such exquisite sculpture be thrown away upon a high pediment?
the affecting expression of the countenance, the head 'bowed
low and full of death,' the gradual failure of the strength and sinking
of the form, the blood slowly trickling from his side&mdash;how could any
spectator, contemplating it at a vast height, be sensible of these minute
traits&mdash;the distinguishing perfections of this matchless statue?"
It was replied, that many of the ancient buildings were so constructed,
that it was possible to ascend and examine the sculpture above the
cornice, and though some statues so placed were unfinished at the back,
(for instance, some of the figures which belonged to the group of Niobe,)
others (and he mentioned the &AElig;gina marbles as an example) were as
highly finished behind as before. I owned myself unwilling to consider
the Gladiator a Gaul, but the reasoning struck me, and I am too
unlearned to weigh the arguments he used, much less confute them.
That the statue being of Grecian marble and Grecian sculpture must
therefore have come from Greece, does not appear a conclusive argument,
since the Romans commonly employed Greek artists: and as to
the rest of the argument,&mdash;suppose that in a dozen centuries hence,
the charming statue of Lady Louisa <a name="Russell" id="Russell"></a>Russell should be discovered under
the ruins of Woburn Abbey, and that by a parity of reasoning, the
production of Chantrey's chisel should be attributed to Italy and Canova,
merely because it is cut from a block of Carrara marble? we
might smile at such a conclusion.</p>

<p>Among the pictures in the gallery of the Capitol, the one most highly
valued pleases me least of all&mdash;the Europa of Paul Veronese. The
splendid colouring and copious fancy of this master can never reconcile
me to his strange anomalies in composition, and his sins against
good taste and propriety. One wishes that he had allayed the heat of
his fancy with some cooling drops of discretion. Even his colouring
so admired in general, has something florid and meretricious to my
eye and taste.</p>

<p>One of the finest pictures here is Domenichino's Cumean Sibyl,
which, like all other masterpieces, defies the copyist and engraver.
The Sibilla Persica of Guercino hangs a little to the left; and with
her contemplative air, and the pen in her hand, she looks as if she
were recording the effusions of her more inspired sister. The former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
is a chaste and beautiful picture, full of feeling and sweetly coloured;
but the vicinity of Domenichino's magnificent creation throws it rather
into shade. Two unfinished pictures upon which Guido was employed
at the time of his death are preserved in the Capitol: one is the Bacchus
and Ariadne, so often engraved and copied; the other, a single
figure, the size of life, represents the Soul of the righteous man ascending
to heaven. Had Guido lived to finish this divine picture, it would have
been one of his most splendid productions; but he was snatched away
to realize, I trust, in his own person, his sublime conception. The
head alone is finished, or nearly so; and has a most extatic expression.
The globe of the earth seems to sink from beneath the floating figure,
which is just sketched upon the canvass, and has a shadowy indistinctness
which to my fancy added to its effect. Guercino's chef-d'&#339;uvre,
the Resurrection of Saint Petronilla, (a saint, I believe, of very hypothetical
fame,) is also here; and has been copied in mosaic for St.
Peters. A magnificent Rubens, the She Wolf nursing Romulus and
Remus; a fine copy of Raffaelle's Triumph of Galatea by Giulo Romano;
Domenichino's Saint Barbara, with the same lovely inspired eyes
he always gives his female saints, and a long et cetera.</p>

<p>From the Capitol we immediately drove to the Borghese palace,
where I spent half an hour looking at the picture <i>called</i> the Cumean
Sibyl of Domenichino, and am more and more convinced that it is a
Saint Cecilia and not a Sibyl.</p>

<p>We have now visited the Borghese palace four times; and &agrave;-propos
to pictures, I may as well make a few memoranda of its contents. It
is not the most numerous, but it is by far the most valuable and select
private gallery in Rome.</p>

<p>Domenichino's Chase of Diana, with the two beautiful nymphs in
the foreground, is a splendid picture. Titian's Sacred and Profane
Love puzzles me completely: I neither understand the name nor the
intention of the picture. It is evidently allegorical: but an allegory
very clumsily expressed. The aspect of Sacred Love would answer
just as well for Profane Love. What is that little cupid about, who is
groping in the cistern behind? why does Profane Love wear gloves?
The picture, though so provokingly obscure in its subject, is most divinely
painted. The three Graces by the same master is also here;
two heads by Giorgione, distinguished by all his peculiar depth of character
and sentiment, some exquisite Albanos; one of Raffaelle's finest
portraits&mdash;and in short, an endless variety of excellence. I feel my
taste become more and more fastidious every day.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>This morning we heard mass at the Pope's Chapel; the service was
read by Cardinal Fesche, and the venerable old pope himself, robed
and mitred <i>en grand costume</i>, was present. No females are allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to enter without veils, and we were very ungallantly shut up behind a
sort of grating, where, though we had a tolerable view of the ceremonial
going forward, it was scarcely possible for us to be seen.
Cardinal Gonsalvi sat so near us, that I had leisure and opportunity to
contemplate the fine intellectual head and acute features of this remarkable
man. I thought his countenance had something of the Wellesley
cast.</p>

<p>The Pope's Chapel is decorated in the most exquisite taste; splendid
at once and chaste. There are no colours&mdash;the whole interior being
white and gold.</p>

<p>At an unfortunate moment, Lady Morgan's ludicrous description of
the twisting and untwisting of the Cardinal's tails came across me, and
made me smile very <i>mal &agrave;-propos</i>: it is certainly from the life.
Whenever this lively and clever woman describes what she has actually
seen with her own eyes, she is as accurately true as she is witty
and entertaining. Her sketches after nature are admirable; but her
observations and inferences are coloured by her peculiar and rather
unfeminine habits of thinking. I never read her "<i>Italy</i>" till the
other day, when L., whose valet had contrived to smuggle it into Rome,
offered to lend it to me. It is one of the books most rigorously proscribed
here; and if the Padre Anfossi or any of his satellites had
discovered it in my hands, I should assuredly have been fined in a sum
beyond what I should have liked to pay.</p>

<p>We concluded the morning at St. Peter's, where we arrived in time
for the anthem.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>23.</i>&mdash;Our visit to the Barberini palace to-day was solely to view the
famous portrait of Beatrice Cenci. Her appalling story is still as fresh
in remembrance here, and her name and fate as familiar in the mouths
of every class, as if instead of two centuries, she had lived two days
ago. In spite of the innumerable copies and prints I have seen, I was
more struck than I can express by the dying beauty of the Cenci. In
the face the expression of heart-sinking anguish and terror is just not
<i>too</i> strong, leaving the loveliness of the countenance unimpaired; and
there is a woe-begone negligence in the streaming hair and loose
drapery which adds to its deep pathos. It is consistent too with the
circumstances under which the picture is traditionally said to have
been painted&mdash;that is, in the interval between her torture and her
execution.</p>

<p>A little daughter of the Princess Barberini was seated in the same
room, knitting. She was a beautiful little creature; and as my eye
glanced from her to the picture and back again, I fancied I could trace
a strong family resemblance; particularly about the eyes, and the very
peculiar mouth. I turned back to ask her whether she had ever been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
told that she was like <i>that</i> picture? pointing to Cenci. She shook back
her long curls, and answered with a blush and a smile, "Yes, often."<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>The Barberini Palace contains other treasures beside the Cenci.
Poussin's celebrated picture of the Death of Germanicus, Raffaelle's
Fornarina, inferior I thought to the one at Florence, and a St. Andrew
by Guido, in his very best style of heads, "mild, pale, and penetrating;"
besides others which I cannot at this moment recall.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>24.</i>&mdash;Yesterday, after chapel, I walked through part of the Vatican;
and then, about vesper-time, entered St. Peter's, expecting to hear the
anthem: but I was disappointed. I found the church as usual crowded
with English, who every Sunday convert St. Peter's into a kind of
Hyde Park, where they promenade arm in arm, show off their finery,
laugh, and talk aloud: as if the size and splendour of the edifice detracted
in any degree from its sacred character. I was struck with a
feeling of disgust; and shocked to see this most glorious temple of the
Deity metamorphosed into a mere theatre. Mr. W. told me this morning,
that in consequence of the shameful conduct of the English, in
pressing in and out of the chapel, occupying all the seats, irreverently
interrupting the service, and almost excluding the natives, the anthem
will not be sung in future.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the behaviour of the English has
created offence, in spite of the friendly feeling which exists towards
us, and the allowances which are made for our national character.
Last year the pope objected to the indecent custom of making St.
Peter's a place of fashionable rendezvous, and notified to Cardinal
Gonsalvi his desire that English ladies and gentlemen should not be
seen arm in arm walking up and down the aisles, during and after
divine service. The cardinal, as the best means of proceeding, spoke
to the Duchess of Devonshire, who signified the wishes of the Papal
Court to a large party, assembled at her house. The hint so judiciously
and so delicately given, was at the time attended to, and during a short
interval the offence complained of ceased. New comers have since
recommenced the same course of conduct: and in fact, nothing <i>could</i>
be worse than the exhibition of gaiety and frivolity, gallantry and
coquetterie at St. Peter's yesterday. I almost wish the pope may interfere,
and with rigour; though, individually, I should lose a high
gratification, if our visits to St. Peter's were interdicted. It is surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
most ill-judged and unfeeling (to say nothing of the <i>profanation</i>, for
such it is), to show such open contempt for the Roman Catholic religion
in its holiest, grandest temple, and under the very eyes of the head of
that church. I blushed for my countrywomen.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>On Christmas Eve we went in a large party to visit some of the
principal churches, and witness the celebration of the Nativity; one
of the most splendid ceremonies of the Romish Church. We arrived
at the chapel of Monte Cavallo about half-past nine; but the pope
being ill and absent, nothing particular was going forward; and we
left it to proceed to the San Luigi dei Francesi, where we found the
church hung from the floor to the ceiling with garlands of flowers,
blazing with light, and resounding with heavenly music: but the
crowd was intolerable, the people dirty, and there was such an
effluence of strong perfumes, in which garlic predominated, that our
physical sensations overcame our curiosity: and we were glad to make
our escape. We then proceeded to the church of the Ara Celi, built
on the site of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and partly from its
ruins. The scene here from the gloomy grandeur and situation of the
church, was exceedingly fine: but we did not stay long enough to see
the concluding procession, as we were told it would be much finer at
the Santa Maria Maggiore; for there the <i>real</i> manger which had
received our Saviour at his birth was deposited: and this inestimable
relic was to be displayed to the eyes of the devout; and with a waxen
figure laid within (called here Il Bambino), was to be carried in procession
round the church, "with pomp, with music, and with triumphing."</p>

<p>The <i>real</i> cradle was a temptation not to be withstood: and to
witness this signal prostration of the human intellect before ignorant
and crafty superstition, we adjourned to the Santa Maria Maggiore.
For processions and shows I care very little, but not for any thing,
not for all I suffered at the moment, would I have missed the scene
which the interior of the church exhibited; for it is impossible that
any description could have given me the faintest idea of it. This most
noble edifice, with its perfect proportions, its elegant Ionic columns,
and its majestic simplicity, appeared transformed, for the time being,
into the temple of some Pagan divinity. Lights and flowers, incense
and music, were all around: and the spacious aisles were crowded
with the lowest classes of the people, the inhabitants of the neighbouring
hills, and the peasantry of the Campagna, who with their wild ruffianlike
figures and picturesque costumes, were lounging about, or seated
at the bases of pillars, or praying before the altars. How I wished to
paint some of the groups I saw! but only Rembrandt could have done
them justice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>We remained at the Santa Maria Maggiore till four o'clock, and no
procession appearing, our patience was exhausted. I nearly fainted
on my chair from excessive fatigue; and some of our party had
absolutely laid themselves down on the steps of an altar, and were fast
asleep; we therefore returned home completely knocked up by the
night's dissipation.</p>

<p><i>27.</i>&mdash;"Come," said L. just now, as he drew his chair to the fire,
and rubbed his hands with great complacency, "I think we've worked
pretty hard to-day; three palaces, four churches&mdash;besides odds and
ends of ruins we dispatched in the way: to say nothing of old Nibby's
lectures in the morning about the Volces, the Saturnines, the Albanians,
and the other old Romans&mdash;by Jove! I almost fancied myself at school
again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>as old Virgil or somebody else says. So now let's have a little &eacute;cart&eacute;
to put it all out of our heads:&mdash;for my brains have turned round like
a windmill, by Jove! ever since I was on the top of that cursed steeple
on the capitol," etc., etc.</p>

<p>I make a resolution to myself every morning before breakfast, that
I will be prepared with a decent stock of good-nature and forbearance,
and not laugh at my friend L.'s absurdities; but in vain are my
amiable intentions: his blunders and his follies surpass all anticipation,
as they defy all powers of gravity. I console myself with the conviction
that such is his slowness of perception, he does not see that he is
the <i>butt</i> of every party; and such his obtuseness of feeling, that if he
did see it, he would not mind it; but he is the heir to twenty-five
thousand a year, and therefore, as R. said, he can afford to be
laughed at.</p>

<p>We "dispatched," as L. says, a good deal to-day, though I did not
"work quite so hard" as the rest of the party: in fact, I was obliged
to return home from fatigue, after having visited the Doria and Sciarra
Palaces (the last for the second time), and the church of San Pietro in
Vincoli.</p>

<p>The Doria Palace contains the largest collection of pictures in Rome:
but they are in a dirty and neglected condition, and many of the best
are hung in the worst possible light: added to this there is such a
number of bad and indifferent pictures, that one ought to visit the
Doria Gallery half a dozen times merely to select those on which a
cultivated taste would dwell with pleasure. Leonardo da Vinci's
portrait of Joanna of Naples, is considered one of the most valuable
pictures in the collection. It exhibits the same cast of countenance
which prevails through all his female heads, a sort of sentimental
simpering affectation which is very disagreeable, and not at all <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>consistent
with the character of Joanna. I was much more delighted by
some magnificent portraits by Titian and Rubens; and by a copy of the
famous antique picture, the Nozze Aldobrandini, executed in a kindred
spirit by the classic pencil of Poussin.</p>

<p>The collection at the Sciarra Palace is small but very select. The
pictures are hung with judgment, and well taken care of. The
Magdalen, which is considered one of Guido's masterpieces, charmed
me most: the countenance is heavenly; though full of ecstatic and devout
contemplation, there is in it a touch of melancholy, "all sorrow's
softness charmed from its despair," which is quite exquisite: and the
attitude, and particularly the turn of the arm, are perfectly graceful:
but why those odious turnips and carrots in the foreground? They
certainly do not add to the sentiment and beauty of the picture.&mdash;Leonardo
da Vinci's Vanity and Modesty, and Caravaggio's Gamblers,
both celebrated pictures in very different styles, are in this collection.
I ought not to forget Raffaelle's beautiful portrait of a young musician
who was his intimate friend. The Doria and Sciarra palaces contain
the only Claudes I have seen in Rome. Since the acquisition of the
Altieri Claudes, we may boast of possessing the finest productions of
this master in England. I remember but one solitary Claude in the
Florentine gallery; and I see none here equal to those at Lord Grosvenor's
and Angerstein's. We visited the church of San Pietro in
Viscoli, to see Michel Angelo's famous statue of Moses,&mdash;of which,
who has not heard? I must confess I never was so disappointed by
any work of art as I was by this statue, which is easily accounted for.
In the first place, I had not seen any model or copy of the original;
and, secondly, I <i>had</i> read Zappi's sublime sonnet, which I humbly
conceive does rather more than justice to its subject. The fine
opening&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Chi e costui che in dura pietra scolto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Siede <i>Gigante</i>"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>gave me the impression of a colossal and elevated figure: my surprise,
therefore, was great to see a sitting statue, not much larger than life,
and placed nearly on the level of the pavement; so that, instead of
looking up at it, I almost looked down upon it. The "Doppio raggio in
fronte," I found in the shape of a pair of horns, which, at the first
glance, gave something quite Satanic to the head, which disgusted me.
When I began to recover from this first disappointment&mdash;although my
eyes were opened gradually to the sublimity of the attitude, the grand
forms of the drapery, and the lips, which unclose as if about to speak&mdash;I
still think that Zappi's sonnet (his acknowledged <a name="chef66" id="chef66"></a>chef-d'&#339;uvre)
is a more sublime production than the chef-d'&#339;uvre it celebrates.</p>

<p>The mention of Zappi reminds me of his wife, the daughter of Carlo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Maratti, the painter. She was so beautiful that she was her father's
favourite model for his Nymphs, Madonnas, and Vestal Virgins; and
to her charms she added virtue, and to her virtue uncommon musical
and literary talents. Among her poems, there is a sonnet addressed
to a lady, once beloved by her husband, beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Donna! che tanto al mio sol piacesti,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which is one of the most graceful, most feeling, most delicate compositions
I ever read. Zappi celebrates his beautiful wife under the name
of Clori, and his first mistress under that of Filli: to the latter he has
addressed a sonnet, which turns on the same thought as Cowley's well
known song, "Love in thine eyes." As they both lived about the
same time, it would be difficult to tell which of the two borrowed from
the other; probably they were both borrowers from some elder
poet.</p>

<p>The characteristics of Zappi's style, are tenderness and elegance; he
occasionally rises to sublimity; as in the sonnet on the Statue of Moses,
and that on Good Friday. He never emulates the flights of Guido or
Filicaja, but he is more uniformly graceful and flowing than either;
his happy thoughts are not spun out too far,&mdash;and his <i>points</i> are seldom
mere <i>concetti</i>.</p>

<p>After being confined to the house for three days, partly by indisposition,
and partly by a vile sirocco, which brought, as usual, vapours,
clouds, and blue devils in its train&mdash;this most lovely day tempted me out;
and I walked with V. over the Monte Cavallo to the Forum of Trajan.
After admiring the view from the summit of the pillar, we went on
towards the Capitol, which presented a singular scene: the square and
street in front, as well as the immense flight of steps, one hundred and
fifty in number, which lead to the church of the Ara Celi, were
crowded with men, women, and children, all in their holiday
dresses. It was with difficulty we made our way through them, though
they very civilly made way for us, and we were nearly a quarter of
an hour mounting the steps, so dense was the multitude ascending and
descending, some on their hands and knees out of extra-devotion. At
last we reached the door of the church, where we understood, from
the exclamations and gesticulations of those of whom we inquired, something
extraordinary was to be seen. On one side of the entrance was
a puppet show, on the other a band of musicians, playing "Di tanti
palpati." The interior of the church was crowded to suffocation; and
all in darkness, except the upper end, where upon a stage brilliantly
and very artificially lighted by unseen lamps, there was an exhibition
in wax-work, as large as life, of the Adoration of the Shepherds. The
Virgin was habited in the court dress of the last century, as rich as
silk and satin, gold lace, and paste diamonds could make it, with a
flaxen wig, and high-heeled shoes. The infant Saviour lay in her lap,
his head encircled with rays of gilt wire, at least two yards long. The
shepherds were very well done, but the sheep and dogs best of all; I
believe they were the real animals stuffed. There was a distant landscape,
seen between the pasteboard trees, which was well painted, and
from the artful disposition of the light and perspective, was almost a
deception&mdash;but by a blunder very consistent with the rest of the show,
it represented a part of the Campagna of Rome. Above all was a profane
representation of that Being, whom I dare scarcely allude to, in
conjunction with such preposterous vanities, encircled with saints,
angels, and clouds; the whole got up very like a scene in a pantomime,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and accompanied by music from a concealed orchestra, which was intended,
I believe, to be sacred music, but sounded to me like some
of Rossini's airs. In front of the stage there was a narrow passage
divided off, admitting one person at a time, through which a continued
file of persons moved along, who threw down their contributions as
they passed, bowing and crossing themselves with great devotion. It
would be impossible to describe the ecstasies of the multitude, the lifting
up of hands and eyes, the string of superlatives&mdash;the bellissimos,
santissimos, gloriosissimos, and maravigliosissimos, with which they
expressed their applause and delight. I stood in the back-ground of
this strange scene, supported on one of the long-legged chairs which
V&mdash;&mdash; placed for me against a pillar, at once amazed, diverted, and disgusted
by this display of profaneness and superstition, till the heat and
crowd overcame me, and I was obliged to leave the church. I shall
never certainly forget the "Bambino" of the Ara Celi: for though
the exhibition I saw afterwards at the San Luigi (where I went to look
at Domenichino's fine pictures) surpassed what I have just described,
it did not so much surprise me. Something in the same style is exhibited
in almost every church, between Christmas day and the
Epiphany.</p>

<p>During our examination of Trajan's Forum to-day, I learnt nothing
new, except that Trajan levelled part of the Quirinal to make room for
it. The ground having lately been cleared to the depth of about
twelve feet, part of the ancient pavement has been discovered, and
many fragments of columns set upright: pieces of frieze and broken
capitals are scattered about. The pillar, which is now cleared to the
base, stands in its original place, but not, as it is supposed, at its original
level, for the Romans generally raised the substructure of their
buildings, in order to give them a more commanding appearance. The
antiquarians here are of opinion that both the pavement of the Basilica
and the base of the pillar were raised above the level of the ancient
street, and that there is a flight of steps, still concealed, between
the pillar and the pavement in front. The famous Ulpian Library was
on each side of the Basilica, and the Forum differed from other Forums
in not being an open space surrounded by buildings, but a building
surrounded by an open space.</p>

<p><i>Dec 31.-Jan. 1.</i>&mdash;That hour in which we pass from one year to
another, and begin a new account with ourselves, with our fellow creatures,
and with God, must surely bring some solemn and serious
thoughts to the bosoms of the most happy and most unreflecting among
the triflers on this earth. What then must it be to me? The first
hour, the first moment of the expiring year was spent in tears, in distress,
in bitterness of heart&mdash;as it began so it ends. Days, and weeks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and months, and seasons, came and "passed like visions to their
viewless home," and brought no change. Through the compass of the
whole year I have not enjoyed one single day&mdash;I will not say of happiness&mdash;but
of health and peace; and what I have endured has left me
little to learn in the way of suffering. Would to heaven that as the
latest minutes now ebb away while I write, memory might also pass
away! Would to heaven that I could efface the last year from the
series of time, hide it from myself, bury it in oblivion, stamp it into
annihilation, that none of its dreary moments might ever rise up again
to haunt me, like spectres of pain and dismay! But this is wrong&mdash;I
feel it is&mdash;and I repent, I recall my wish. That great Being, to
whom the life of a human creature is a mere point, but who has bestowed
on his creatures such capacities of feeling and suffering, as extend
moments to hours and days to years, inflicts nothing in vain, and
if I have suffered much, I have also learned much. Now the last hour
is past&mdash;another year opens; may it bring to those I love all I wish
them in my heart! to me it can bring nothing. The only blessing I
hope from time is <i>forgetfulness</i>&mdash;my only prayer to heaven is&mdash;<i>rest,
rest, rest</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 4.</i>&mdash;We <i>dispatched</i>, as L** would say, a good deal to-day:
we visited the Temple of Vesta, the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmadino,
the Temple of Fortune, the Ponte Rotto, and the house of
Nicolo Rienzi: all these lie together in a dirty, low, and disagreeable
part of Rome. Thence we drove to the Pyramid of Caius Cestus.&mdash;As
we know nothing of this Caius Cestus, but that he lived, died, and was
buried, it is not possible to attach any fanciful or classical interest to
his tomb, but it is an object of so much beauty in itself, and from its
situation so striking and picturesque, that it needs no additional interest.
It is close to the ancient walls of Rome, which stretch on either side as
far as the eye can reach in huge and broken masses of brickwork,
fragments of battlements and buttresses, overgrown in many parts with
shrubs and even trees. Around the base of the Pyramid lies the
burying-ground of strangers and heretics. Many of the monuments
are elegant, and their frail materials and diminutive forms are in affecting
contrast with the lofty and solid pile which towers above them.
The tombs lie around in a small space "amicably close," like brothers
in exile, and as I gazed I felt a kindred feeling with all; for I, too, am
a wanderer, a stranger and a heretic; and it is probable that my place
of rest may be among them. Be it so! for methinks this earth could
not afford a more lovely, a more tranquil, or more sacred spot. I remarked
one tomb, which is an exact model, and in the same material
with the sarcophagus of Cornelius Scipio, in the Vatican. One small
slab of white marble bore the name of a young girl, an only child, who
died at sixteen, and "left her parents disconsolate:" another elegant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and simple monument bore the name of a young painter of genius and
promise, and was erected "by his companions and fellow students as
a testimony of their affectionate admiration and regret." This part of
old Rome is beautiful beyond description, and has a wild, desolate,
and poetical grandeur, which affects the imagination like a dream.&mdash;The
very air disposes one to reverie. I am not surprised that Poussin,
Claude, and Salvator Rosa made this part of Rome a favourite
haunt, and studied here their finest effects of colour, and their grandest
combinations of landscape. I saw a young artist seated on a pile of
ruins with his sketch book open on his knee, and his pencil in his
hand&mdash;during the whole time we were there he never changed his attitude,
nor put his pencil to the paper, but remained leaning on his elbow,
like one lost in ecstasy.</p>

<p><i>Jan 5.</i>&mdash;To-day we drove through the quarter of the Jews, called
the Ghetta degli Ebrei. It is a long street enclosed at each end with
a strong iron gate, which is locked by the police at a certain hour every
evening (I believe at ten o'clock); and any Jew found without its
precincts after that time, is liable to punishment and a heavy fine. The
street is narrow and dirty, the houses wretched and ruinous, and the
appearance of the inhabitants squalid, filthy, and miserable&mdash;on the
whole, it was a painful scene, and one I should have avoided, had I
followed my own inclinations. If this specimen of the effects of superstition
and ignorance was depressing, the next was not less ridiculous.
We drove to the Lateran: I had frequently visited this noble
Basilica before, but on the present occasion we were to go over it <i>in
form</i>, with the usual torments of laquais and ciceroni. I saw nothing
new but the cloisters, which remain exactly as in the time of Constantine.
They are in the very vilest style of architecture, and decorated
with Mosaic in a very elaborate manner: but what most amused us
was the collection of relics, said to have been brought by Constantine
from the Holy Land, and which our cicerone exhibited with a sneering
solemnity which made it very doubtful whether he believed himself
in their miraculous sanctity. Here is the stone on which the cock
was perched when it crowed to St. Peter, and a pillar from the Temple
of Jerusalem, split asunder at the time of the crucifixion; it looks as
if it had been <i>sawed</i> very accurately in half from top to bottom; but
this of course only renders it more miraculous. Here is also the
column in front of Pilate's house, to which our Saviour was bound,
and the very well where he met the woman of Samaria. All these,
and various other relics, supposed to be consecrated by our Saviour's
Passion, are carelessly thrown into the cloisters&mdash;not so the heads of
St. Peter and St. Paul, which are considered as the chief treasures in
the Lateran, and are deposited in the body of the church in a rich
shrine. The beautiful sarcophagus of red porphyry, which once stood in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the Portico of the Pantheon, and contained the ashes of Agrippa, is now
in the Corsini chapel here, and encloses the remains of some Pope Clement.
The bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which stands
on the Capitol, was dug from the cloisters of the Lateran. The statue
of Constantine in the portico was found in the baths of Constantine:
it is in a style of sculpture worthy the architecture of the cloisters.&mdash;Constantine
was the first Christian emperor, a glory which has served
to cover a multitude of sins; it is indeed impossible to forget that he
was the chosen instrument of a great and blessed revolution; but in
other respects it is as impossible to look back to the period of Constantine
without horror&mdash;an era when bloodshed and barbarism, and the
general depravity of morals and taste seemed to have reached their
climax.</p>

<p>On leaving the Lateran, we walked to the Scala Santa, said to be
the very flights of steps which led to the judgment hall at Jerusalem,
and transported hither by the Emperor Constantine; but while the
other relics which his pious benevolence bestowed on the city of Rome
have apparently lost some of their efficacy, the Scala Santa is still regarded
with the most devout veneration. At the moment of our approach,
an elegant barouche drove up to the portico, from which two
well-dressed women alighted, and pulling out their rosaries, began to
crawl up the steps on their hands and knees, repeating a Paternoster
and an Ave Maria on every step. A poor diseased beggar had just
gone up before them, and was a few steps in advance. This exercise,
as we are assured, purchases a thousand years of indulgence. The
morning was concluded by a walk on the Mont Pincio.</p>

<p>I did not know on that first morning after our arrival, when I ran
up the Scalla della Trinit&agrave; to the top of the Pincian hill, and looked
around me with such transport, that I stood by mere chance on that
very spot from which Claude used to study his sun sets, and his beautiful
effects of evening. His house was close to me on the left, and
those of Nicolo Poussin and Salvator Rosa a little beyond. Since they
have been pointed out to me, I never pass from the Monte Pincio along
the Via Felice without looking up at them with interest: such power
has genius, "to hallow in the core of human hearts even the ruin of a
wall."</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Jan. 6.</i>&mdash;Sunday, at the English chapel, which was crowded to excess,
and where it was at once cold and suffocating. We had a plain
but excellent sermon, and the officiating clergyman, Mr. W., exhorted
the congregation to conduct themselves with more decorum at St.
Peter's, and to remember what was due to the temple of that God
who was equally the God of all Christians. We afterwards went to
St. Peter's; where the anthem was performed at vespers as usual, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the tenor of the Argentino sung. The music was indeed heavenly&mdash;but
I did not enjoy it: for though the behaviour of the English was
much more decent than I have yet seen it, the crowd round the chapel,
the talking, pushing, whispering, and movement, were enough to
disquiet and discomfort me; I withdrew, therefore, and walked about
at a little distance, where I could just hear the swell of the organ.
Such is the immensity of the building, that at the other side of the
aisle the music is perfectly inaudible.</p>

<p><i>7.</i>&mdash;Visited the Falconieri Palace to see Cardinal Fesche's gallery.
The collection is large and contains many fine pictures, but there is
such a <i>m&eacute;lange</i> of good, bad, and indifferent, that on the whole I was
disappointed. L** attached himself to my side the whole morning&mdash;to
benefit, as he said, by my "tasty remarks;" he hung so dreadfully
heavy on my hands, and I was so confounded by the interpretations and
explanations his ignorance required, that I at last found my patience
nearly at an end. Pity he is so good-natured and so good-tempered,
that one can neither have the comfort of heartily disliking him, nor
find nor make the shadow of an excuse to shake him off!</p>

<p>In the evening we had a gay party of English and foreigners: among
them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>9.</i>&mdash;We have had two days of truly English weather; cold, damp,
and gloomy, with storms of wind and rain. I know not why, but
there is something peculiarly deforming and discordant in bad weather
here; and we are all rather stupid and depressed. To me, sunshine
and warmth are substitutes for health and spirits; and their absence
inflicts positive suffering. There is not a single room in our palazzetto
which is weather-proof; and as to a good fire, it is a luxury unknown,
but not unnecessary, in these regions. In such apartments as
contain no fire-place, a stufa, or portable stove, is set, which diffuses
little warmth, and renders the air insupportably close and suffocating.</p>

<p>I witnessed a scene last night, which was a good illustration of that
extraordinary indolence for which the Romans are remarkable. Our
laquais Camillo suffered himself to be turned off, rather than put wood
on the fire three times a-day; he would rather, he said, "starve in
the streets than break his back by carrying burdens like an ass; and
though he was miserable to displease the Onoratissimo Padrone, his
first <i>duty</i> was to take care of his own health, which, with the blessing
of the saints, he was determined to do." R&mdash;&mdash; threw him his wages,
repeating with great contempt the only word of his long speech he understood,
"<i>Asino!</i>" "Sono Romano, io," replied the fellow, drawing
himself up with dignity. He look his wages, however, and
marched out of the house.</p>

<p>The impertinence of this Camillo was sometimes amusing, but oftener
provoking. He piqued himself on being a profound antiquarian,
would confute Nibby, and carried Nardini in his pocket, to whom he
referred on all occasions: yet the other day he had the impudence to
assure us that Caius Cestus was an English Protestant, who was excommunicated
by Pope Julius C&aelig;sar; and took his Nardini out of his
pocket to prove his assertion.</p>

<p>V&mdash;&mdash; brought me to-day the "Souvenirs de F&eacute;licie," of Madame de
Genlis, which amused me delightfully for a few hours. They contain
many truths, many half or whole falsehoods, many impertinent things,
and several very interesting anecdotes. They are written with all the
graceful simplicity of style, and in that tone of lady-like feeling which
distinguishes whatever she writes: but it is clear that though she represents
these "Souvenirs" as mere extracts from her journal, they have
been carefully composed or re-composed for publication, and were always
intended to be seen. Now if my poor little Diary should ever be

<p><i>10.</i>&mdash;A lovely brilliant day, the sky without a cloud and the air as
soft as summer. The carriages were ordered immediately after breakfast,

usual felicitous application of Shakspeare,</p>

</div></div>

<p>The baths of Titus are on the &AElig;squiline; and nothing remains of them
but piles of brickwork, and a few subterranean chambers almost choked
with rubbish. Some fragments of exquisite arabesque painting are
visible on the ceilings and walls; and the gilding and colours are still
fresh and bright. The brickwork is perfectly solid and firm, and appeared
as if finished yesterday. On the whole the impression on my
mind was, that not the slow and gentle hand of time, but sudden rapine
and violence had caused the devastation around us; and looking
into Nardini on my return, I found that the baths of Titus were nearly
entire in the thirteenth century, but were demolished with great labour
and difficulty by the ferocious Senator Brancaleone, who, about the
year 1257, destroyed an infinite number of ancient edifices, "per
togliere ai Nobili il modo di fortificarsi." The ruins were excavated
during the pontificate of Julius the Second, and under the direction of
Raffaelle, who is supposed to have taken the idea of the arabesques in
the Loggie of the Vatican, from the paintings here. We were shown
the niche in which the Laocoon stood, when it was discovered in 1502.
After leaving the baths, we entered the neighbouring church of San
Pietro in Vincoli, to look again at the beautiful fluted Doric columns
which once adorned the splendid edifice of Titus: and on this occasion
we were shown the chest in which the fetters of St. Peter are
preserved in a triple enclosure of iron, wood, and silver. My unreasonable
curiosity not being satisfied by looking at the mere outside
of this sacred coffer, I turned to the monk who exhibited it,
and civilly requested that he would open it, and show us the miraculous
treasure it contained. The poor man looked absolutely astounded
and aghast at the audacity of my request, and stammered
out, that the coffer was never opened, without a written order from his
holiness the pope, and in the presence of a cardinal, and, that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
favour was never granted to a heretic (con rispetto parlando); and
with this excuse we were obliged to be satisfied.</p>

<p>The church of San Martino del Monte is built on part of the substructure
of the baths of Titus; and there is a door opening from the
church, by which you descend into the ancient subterranean vaults.
The small, but exquisite pillars, and the pavement, which is of the
richest marbles, were brought from the Villa of Adrian at Tivoli.
The walls were painted in fresco by Nicolo and Gaspar Poussin, and
were once a celebrated study for young landscape painters; almost
every vestige of colouring is now obliterated by the damp which streams
down the walls. There are some excellent modern pictures in good
preservation, I think by Carluccio. This church, though not large, is
one of the most magnificent we have yet seen, and the most precious
materials are lavished in profusion on every part. The body of Cardinal
Tomasi is preserved here, embalmed in a glass case. It is exhibited
conspicuously, and in my life I never saw (or smelt) anything
so abominable and disgusting.</p>

<p>The rest of the morning was spent in the Vatican.</p>

<p>I stood to-day for some time between those two great masterpieces,
the Transfiguration of Raffaelle, and Domenichino's Communion of St.
Jerome. I studied them, I examined them figure by figure, and then
in the ensemble, and mused upon the different effects they produce, and
were designed to produce, until I thought I could decide to my own
satisfaction on their respective merits. I am not ignorant that the
Transfiguration is pronounced the "grandest picture in the world,"
nor so insensible to excellence as to regard this glorious composition
without all the admiration due to it. I am dazzled by the flood of light
which bursts from the opening heavens above, and affected by the dramatic
interest of the group below. What splendour of colour! What
variety of expression! What masterly grouping of the heads! I see
all this&mdash;but to me Raffaelle's picture wants unity of interest: it is two
pictures in one: the demoniac boy in the foreground always shocks
me; and thus from my peculiarity of taste the pleasure it gives me is
not so perfect as it ought to be.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I never can turn to the Domenichino without
being thrilled with emotion, and touched with awe. The story is told
with the most admirable skill, and with the most exquisite truth and
simplicity: the interest is one and the same; it all centres in the person
of the expiring saint; and the calm benignity of the officiating priest is
finely contrasted with the countenances of the group who support the
dying form of St. Jerome: anxious tenderness, grief, hope, and fear,
are expressed with such deep pathos and reality, that the spectator
forgets admiration in sympathy; and I have gazed, till I could almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
have fancied myself one of the assistants. The colouring is as admirable
as the composition&mdash;gorgeously rich in effect, but subdued to a
tone which harmonizes with the solemnity of the subject.</p>

<p>There is a curious anecdote connected with this picture, which I wish
I had noted down at length as it was related to me, and at the time I
heard it: it is briefly this. The picture was painted by Domenichino
for the church of San <a name="Girolamo" id="Girolamo"></a>Girolamo della Carit&agrave;. At that time the factions
between the different schools of painting ran so high at Rome, that the
followers of Domenichino and Guido absolutely stabbed and poisoned
each other; and the popular prejudice being in favour of the latter, the
Communion of St. Jerome was torn down from its place, and flung into
a lumber garret. Some time afterwards, the superiors of the convent
wishing to substitute a new altar-piece, commissioned Nicolo Poussin
to execute it; and sent him Domenichino's rejected picture as old canvas
to paint upon. No sooner had the generous Poussin cast his eyes on it,
than he was struck, as well he might be, with astonishment and admiration.
He immediately carried it into the church, and there lectured
in public on its beauties, until he made the stupid monks ashamed of
their blind rejection of such a masterpiece, and boldly gave it that character
it has ever since retained, of being the second best picture in the
world.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>11.</i>&mdash;A party of four, including L** and myself, ascended the dome
of St. Peter's; and even mounted into the gilt ball. It was a most fatiguing
expedition, and one I have since repented. I gained, however, a
more perfect, and a more sublime idea of the architectural wonders
of St. Peter's, than I had before; and I was equally pleased and surprised
by the exquisite neatness and cleanliness of every part of the
building. We drove from St. Peter's to the church of St. Onofrio, to
visit the tomb of Tasso. A plain slab marks the spot, which requires
nothing but his name to distinguish it. "After life's fitful fever he
sleeps well." The poet Guidi lies in a little chapel close by; and his
effigy is so placed that the eyes appear fixed upon the tomb of Tasso.</p>

<p>In the church of Santa Maria Trastevere (which is held in peculiar
reverence by the Tresteverini), there is nothing remarkable, except that
like many others in Rome, it is rich in the spoils of antique splendour:
afterwards to the palazzo Farneze and the Farnesina, to see the frescos
of Raffaelle, Giulio Romano, and the Caraccis, which have long been
rendered familiar to me in copies and engravings.</p>

<p><i>12.</i>&mdash;I did penance at home for the fatigue of the day before, and to-day
(the 13th) I took a delightful drive of several hours attended only
by Saccia. Having examined at different times, and in detail, most
of the interesting objects within the compass of the ancient city, I wished
to generalize what I had seen, by a kind of <i>survey</i> of the whole. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
this purpose, making the Capitol a central point, I drove first slowly
through the Forum, and made the circuit of the Palatine Hill, then by
the arch of Janus (which by a late decision of the antiquarians, has no
more to do with Janus than with Jupiter), and the temple of Vesta,
back again over the site of the Circus Maximus, between the Palatine
and the Aventine (the scene of the Rape of the Sabines), to the baths of
Caracalla, where I spent an hour, musing, sketching, and poetizing;
thence to the church of San Stefano Rotundo, once a temple dedicated
to Claudius by Agrippina; over the Celian Hill, covered with masses
of ruins, to the church of St. John and St. Paul, a small but beautiful
edifice; then to the neighbouring church of San Gregorio, from the
steps of which there is such a noble view. Thence I returned by the
arch of Constantine, and the Coliseum, which frowned on me in black
masses through the soft but deepening twilight, through the street now
called the Suburra, but formerly the Via Scelerata, where Tullia
trampled over the dead body of her father, and so over the Quirinal
home.</p>

<p>My excursion was altogether delightful, and gave me the most magnificent,
and I had almost said, the most <i>bewildering</i> ideas of the grandeur
and extent of ancient Rome. Every step was classic ground: illustrious
names, and splendid recollections crowded upon the fancy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And trailing clouds of glory did they come."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the Palatine Hill were the houses of Cicero and the Gracchi;
Horace, Virgil, and Ovid resided on the Aventine; and Mec&aelig;nas and
Pliny on the &AElig;squiline. If one little fragment of a wall remained,
which could with any shadow of probability be pointed out as belonging
to the residence of Cicero, Horace, or Virgil, how much dearer,
how much more sanctified to memory would it be than all the magnificent
ruins of the fabrics of the C&aelig;sars! But no&mdash;all has passed away.
I have heard the remains of Rome coarsely ridiculed, because, after
the researches of centuries, so little is comparatively known&mdash;because
of the endless disputes of antiquarians, and the night and ignorance in
which all is involved; but to the imagination there is something singularly
striking in this mysterious veil which hangs like a cloud upon the
objects around us. I trod to-day over the shapeless masses of building,
extending in every direction as far as the eye could reach. Who had
inhabited the edifices I trampled under my feet? What hearts had
burned&mdash;what heads had thought&mdash;what spirits had kindled <i>there</i>,
where nothing was seen but a wilderness and waste, and heaps of ruins,
to which antiquaries&mdash;even Nibby himself&mdash;dare not give a name? All
swept away&mdash;buried beneath an ocean of oblivion, above which rise a
few great and glorious names, like rocks, over which the billows of
time break in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most striking scenes I saw to-day was the Roman forum,
crowded with the common people gaily dressed (it is a festa or saint's
day); the women sitting in groups upon the fallen columns, nursing or
amusing their children. The men were playing at mora, or at a game
like quoits. Under the vast side of the Palatine Hill, on the side of
the Circus Maximus, I met a woman mounted on an ass, habited in a
most beautiful and singular holiday costume, a man walked by her side,
leading the animal she rode, with lover-like watchfulness. He was
<i>en veste</i>, and I observed that his cloak was thrown over the back of
the ass as a substitute for a saddle. Two men followed behind with
their long capotes hanging from their shoulders, and carrying guitars,
which they struck from time to time, singing as they walked along.
A little in advance there is a small chapel, and Madona. A young girl
approached, and laying a bouquet of flowers before the image, she
knelt down, hid her face in her apron, and wrung her hands from time
to time as if she was praying with fervor. When the group I have
just mentioned came up, they left the pathway, and made a circuit of
many yards to avoid disturbing her, the men taking off their hats, and
the woman inclining her head, in sign of respect, as they passed.</p>

<p>All this sounds, while I soberly write it down, very sentimental, and
picturesque, and poetical. It was exactly what I saw&mdash;what I often
see: such is the place, the scenery, the people. Every group is a
picture, the commonest object has some interest attached to it, the
commonest action is dignified by sentiment, the language around us is
music, and the air we breathe is poetry.</p>

<p>Just as I was writing the word <i>music</i>, the sounds of a guitar attracted
me to the window, which looks into a narrow back street, and
is exactly opposite a small white house belonging to a vetturino, who
has a very pretty daughter. For her this <a name="serenade" id="serenade"></a>serenade was evidently intended;
for the moment the music began, she placed a light in the
window as a signal that she listened propitiously, and then retired. The
group below consisted of two men, the lover and a musician he had
brought with him: the former stood looking up at the window with
his hat off, and the musician, after singing two very beautiful airs,
concluded with the delicious and popular Arietta "Buona notte, amato
bene!" to which the lover <i>whistled</i> a second, in such perfect tune, and
with such exquisite taste, that I was enchanted. Rome is famous for
serenades and serenaders; but at this season they are seldom heard.
I remember at Venice being wakened in the dead of the night by such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
delicious music, that (to use a hyperbole common in the mouths of
this poetical people) I was "transported to the seventh heaven:" before
I could perfectly recollect myself, the music ceased, the inhabitants
of the neighbouring houses threw open their casements, and
vehemently and enthusiastically applauded, clapping their hands, and
shouting bravos: but neither at Venice, at Padua, nor at Florence did
I hear any thing that pleased and touched me so much as the serenade
to which I have just been listening.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>14.</i>&mdash;To-day was quite heavenly&mdash;like a lovely May-day in England:
the air so pure, so soft, and the sun so warm, that I would
gladly have dispensed with my shawl and pelisse. We went in carriages
to the other side of the Palatine, and then dispersing in small
parties, as will or fancy led, we lounged and wandered about in the
Coliseum, and among the neighbouring ruins till dinner time. I
climbed up the western side of the Coliseum, at the imminent hazard
of my neck; and looking down through a gaping aperture, on the
brink of which I had accidentally seated myself, I saw in the colossal
corridor far below me, a young artist, who, as if transported out of
his senses by delight and admiration, was making the most extraordinary
antics and gestures: sometimes he clasped his hands, then extended
his arms, then stood with them folded as in deep thought; now
he snatched up his portfolio as if to draw what so much enchanted him,
then threw it down and kicked it from him as if in despair. I never
saw such admirable dumb show: it was better than any pantomime.
At length, however, he happened to cast up his eyes, as if appealing to
heaven, and they encountered mine peeping down upon him from
above. He stood fixed and motionless for two seconds, staring at me,
and then snatching up his portfolio and his hat, ran off and disappeared.
I met the same man afterwards walking along the Via Felice, and
could not help smiling as he passed: he smiled too, but pulled his hat
over his face and turned away.</p>

<p>I discovered to-day (and it is no slight pleasure to make a discovery
for one's self), the passage which formed the communication between
the Coliseum and the Palace of the C&aelig;sars, and in which the Emperor
Commodus was assassinated. I recognized it by its situation, and the
mosaic pavement described by Nibby. If I had time I might moralize
here, and make an eloquent tirade <i>&agrave; la Eustace</i> about imperial
monsters and so forth,&mdash;but in fact I <i>did</i> think while I stood in the
damp and gloomy corridor, that it was a fitting death for Commodus to
die by the giddy playfulness of a child, and the machinations of an
abandoned woman. It was not a favourable time or hour to <a name="contemplate" id="contemplate"></a>contemplate
the Coliseum&mdash;the sunshine was too resplendent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a garish, broad, and peering day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud, light, suspicious, full of eyes and ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every little corner, nook, and hole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was penetrated by the insolent light.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are told that five thousand animals were slain in the amphitheatre
on its dedication&mdash;how dreadful! The mutual massacres of
the gladiators inspire less horror than this disgusting butchery! To
what a pitch must the depraved appetite for blood and death have risen
among the corrupted and ferocious populace, before such a sight could
be endured!</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>15.</i>&mdash;We drove to-day to the tomb of Cecilia Metella, on the Appian
Way, to the Fountain of Egeria, and the tomb of the Scipios near
the Porta Cappena.</p>

<p>I wish the tomb of Cecilia Metella had been that of Cornelia or
Valeria. There may be little in a name, but how much there is in
association! What this massy fabric wanted in classical fame Lord
Byron has lately supplied in poetical interest. The same may be said
of the Fountain of Egeria, to which he has devoted some of the most
exquisite stanzas in his poem, and has certainly invested it with a
charm it could not have possessed before. The woods and groves
which once surrounded it, have been all cut down, and the scenery
round it is waste and bleak; but the fountain itself is pretty, overgrown
with ivy, moss, and the graceful capillaire plant (capello di
venere) drooping from the <a name="walls" id="walls"></a>walls, and the stream is as pure as crystal.
L**, who was with us, took up a stone to break off a piece of the statue,
and maimed, defaced, and wretched as it is, I could not help thinking
it a profanation to the place, and stopped his hand, calling him a
<i>barbarous Vandyke</i>: he looked so awkwardly alarmed and puzzled
by the epithet I had given him! The identity of this spot (like all
other places here) has been vehemently disputed. At every step to-day
we encountered doubt, and contradiction, and cavilling: authorities
are marshalled against each other in puzzling array, and the modern
unwillingness to be cheated by fine sounds and great names has become
a general scepticism. I have no objection to the "shadows,
doubts, and darkness" which rest upon all around us; it rather pleases
my fancy thus to "dream over the map of things," abandoned to my
own cogitations and my own conclusions; but then there are certain
points upon which it is very disagreeable to have one's faith disturbed;
and the Fountain of Egeria is one of these. So leaving the more
learned antiquarians to fight it out, <i>secundum artem</i>, and fire each
other's wigs if they will, I am determined, and do steadfastly believe,
that the Fountain of Egeria I saw to-day is the very identical and
original Fountain of Egeria&mdash;of Numa's Egeria&mdash;and therefore it <i>is</i> so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The tomb of the Scipios is a dirty dark wine cellar: all the urns,
the fine sarcophagus, and the original tablets and inscriptions have been
removed to the Vatican. I thought to-day while I stood in the sepulchre,
and on the very spot whence the sarcophagus of Publius was removed,
if Scipio, or Augustus, or Adrian, could return to this world,
how would their Roman pride endure to see their last resting-places,
the towers and the pyramids in which they fortified themselves, thus
violated and put to ignoble uses, and the urns which contained their
ashes stuck up as ornaments in a painted room, where barbarian visitors
lounge away their hours, and stare upon their relics with
scornful indifference or idle curiosity!</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>The people here, even the lowest and meanest among them seem to
have imbibed a profound respect for antiquity and antiquities, which
sometimes produces a comic effect. I am often amused by the exultation
with which they point out a bit of old stone, or piece of brick
wall, or shapeless fragment of some nameless statue, and tell you it is
<i>antico, molto, antico</i>, and the half contemptuous tone in which they
praise the most beautiful modern production, <i>&eacute; moderna&mdash;ma pure
non &eacute; cativ&agrave;!</i></p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>18.</i>&mdash;We had an opportunity of witnessing to-day one of the most
splendid ceremonies of the Catholic church. It is one of the four festivals
at which the Pope performs mass in state at the Vatican, the anniversary
of St. Peter's entrance into Rome, and of his taking possession
of the Papal chair; for here St. Peter is reckoned the first Pope.
To see the high priest of an ancient and wide-spread superstition publicly
officiate in his sacred character, in the grandest temple in the
universe, and surrounded by all the trappings of his spiritual and temporal
authority, was an exhibition to make sad a reflecting mind, but to
please and exalt a lively imagination: I wished myself a Roman Catholic
for one half hour only. The procession, which was so arranged
as to produce the most striking theatrical effect, moved up the central
aisle, to strains of solemn and beautiful music from an orchestra of
wind instruments. The musicians were placed out of sight, nor could
I guess from what part of the buildings the sounds proceeded; but the
blended harmony, so soft, yet so powerful and so equally diffused, as
it floated through the long aisles and lofty domes, had a most heavenly
effect. At length appeared the Pope, borne on the shoulders of his
attendants, and habited in his full Pontifical robes of white and gold;
fans of peacocks' feathers were waved on each side of his throne, and
boys flung clouds of incense from their censers. As the procession
advanced at the slowest possible foot-pace, the Pope from time to time
stretched forth his arms which were crossed upon his bosom, and solemnly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
blessed the people as they prostrated themselves on each side. I
could have fancied it the triumphant approach of an Eastern despot,
but for the mild and venerable air of the amiable old Pope, who looked
as if more humbled than exalted by the pageantry around him. It
might be <i>acting</i>, but if so, it was the most admirable acting I ever
saw: I wish all his attendants had performed their parts as well.
While the Pope assists at mass, it is not etiquette for him to do anything
for himself: one Cardinal kneeling, holds the book open before
him, another carries his handkerchief, a third folds and unfolds his
robe, a priest on each side supports him whenever he rises or moves,
so that he appears among them like a mere helpless automaton going
through a certain set of mechanical motions, with which his will has
nothing to do. All who approach or address him prostrate themselves
and kiss his embroidered slipper before they rise.</p>

<p>When the whole ceremony was over, and most of the crowd dispersed,
the Pope, after disrobing, was passing through a private part
of the church where we were standing accidentally, looking at one of
the monuments. We made the usual obeisance, which he returned
by inclining his head. He walked without support, but with great difficulty,
and appeared bent by infirmity and age: his countenance has a
melancholy but most benevolent expression, and his dark eyes retain
uncommon lustre and penetration. During the twenty-one years he
has worn the tiara, he has suffered many vicissitudes and humiliations
with dignity and fortitude. He is not considered a man of very powerful
intellect or very shining talents: he is not a Ganganelli or a
Lambertini; but he has been happy in his choice of ministers, and his
government has been distinguished by a spirit of liberality, and above
all by a partiality to the English, which calls for our respect and gratitude.
There were present to-day in St. Peter's about five thousand
people, and the church would certainly have contained ten times the
number.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>19.</i>&mdash;We went to-day to view the restored model of the Coliseum
exhibited in the Piazza di Spagna; and afterwards drove to the manufactory
of the beads called <i>Roman Pearl</i>, which is well worth seeing
<i>once</i>. The beads are cut from thin lamin&aelig; of alabaster, and then
dipped into a composition made of the scales of a fish (the Argentina).
When a perfect imitation of pearl is intended, they can copy the accidental
defects of colour and form which occur in the real gem, as
well as its brilliance, so exquisitely, as to deceive the most practised
eye.</p>

<p><i>20.</i>&mdash;I ordered the open carriage early this morning, and, attended
only by Scaccia, partly drove and partly walked through some of the
finest parts of ancient Rome. The day has been perfectly lovely; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
sky intensely blue without a single cloud; and though I was weak and
far from well, I felt the influence of the soft sunshine in every nerve:
the pure elastic air seemed to penetrate my whole frame, and made
my spirits bound and my heart beat quicker. It is true, I had to regret
at every step the want of a more cultivated companion, and that I
felt myself shamefully&mdash;no&mdash;not <i>shamefully</i>, but <i>lamentably</i> ignorant
of many things. There is so much of which I wish to know and learn
more: so much of my time is spent in hunting books, and acquiring by
various means the information with which I ought already to be prepared;
so many days are lost by frequent indisposition, that though I
enjoy, and feel the value of all I <i>do</i> know and observe, I am tantalized by
the thoughts of all I must leave behind me unseen&mdash;there must necessarily
be so much of what I do not even <i>hear</i>! Yet, in spite of these
drawbacks, my little excursion to-day was delightful. I took a direction
just contrary to my last expedition, first by the Quattro Fontane
to the Santa Maria Maggiore, which I always see with new delight;
then to the ruins called the temple of Minerva Medici, which stand in
a cabbage garden near another fine ruin, once called the Trofei di
Mario, and now the Acqua Giulia: thence to the Porta Maggiore,
built by Claudius; and round by the Santa Croce di Gerusalemme.
This church was built by Helena, the mother of Constantine, and contains
her tomb, besides a portion of the <i>True Cross</i> from which it derives
its name. The interior of this Basilica struck me as mean and
cold. In the fine avenue in front of the Santa Croce, I paused a few
minutes to look round me. To the right were the ruins of the stupendous
Claudian Aqueduct with its gigantic arches, stretching away
in one unbroken series far into the Campagna: behind me the amphitheatre
of Castrense: to the left, other ruins, once called the Temple
of Venus and Cupid, and now the Sessorium: in front, the Lateran,
the obelisk of Sesostris, the Porta San Giovanni, and great part of
the ancient walls; and thence the view extended to the foot of the
Apennines. All this part of Rome is a scene of magnificent desolation,
and of melancholy yet sublime interest: its wildness, its vastness, its
waste and solitary openness, add to its effect upon the imagination.
The only human beings I beheld in the compass of at least two miles,
were a few herdsmen driving their cattle through the gate of San Giovanni,
and two or three strangers who were sauntering about with
their note books and portfolios, apparently enthusiasts like myself,
lost in the memory of the past and the contemplation of the present.</p>

<p>I spent some time in the Lateran, then drove to the Coliseum, where
I found a long procession of penitents, their figures and faces totally
concealed by their masks and peculiar dress, chaunting the Via Crucis.
I then examined the site of the Temple of Venus and Rome, and satisfied
myself by ocular demonstration of the truth of the measurements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
which gave sixty feet for the height of the columns and eighteen feet
for the circumference. I knew enough of geometrical proportion to
prove this to my own satisfaction. On examining the fragments which
remain, each fluting measured a foot, that is, eight inches right across.
This appears prodigious, but it is nevertheless true. I am forced to
believe to-day what I yesterday doubted, and deemed a piece of mere
antiquarian exaggeration.</p>

<p>This magnificent edifice was designed and built by the Emperor
Adrian, who piqued himself on his skill in architecture, and carried
his jealousy of other artists so far, as to banish Apollodorus, who had
designed the Forum of Trajan. When he had finished the Temple of
Venus and Rome, he sent to Apollodorus a plan of his stupendous structure,
challenging him to find a single fault in it. The architect severely
criticised some trifling oversights; and the Emperor, conscious
of the justice of his criticisms, and unable to remedy the defects, ordered
him to be strangled. Such was the fate of Apollodorus, whose
misfortune it was to have an Emperor for his rival.</p>

<p>They are now clearing the steps which lead to this temple, from
which it appears that the length of the portico in front was three hundred
feet, and of the side five hundred feet.</p>

<p>While I was among these ruins, I was struck by a little limpid
fountain, which gushed from the crumbling wall and lost itself among
the fragments of the marble pavement. All looked dreary and desolate;
and that part of the ruin which from its situation must have been
the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, the shrine of the divinity of the place, is now
a receptacle of filth and every conceivable abomination.</p>

<p>I walked on to the ruins now called the Basilica of Constantine,
once the Temple of Peace. This edifice was in a bad style, and constructed
at a period when the arts were at a low ebb: yet the ruins are
vast and magnificent. The exact direction of the Via Sacra has long
been a subject of vehement dispute. They have now laid open a part
of it which ran in front of the Basilica: the pavement is about twelve
feet below the present pavement of Rome, and the soil turned up in
their excavations is formed entirely of crumbled brickwork and mortar,
and fragments of marble, porphyry, and granite. I returned by the
Forum and the Capitol, through the Forums of Nerva and Trajan,
and so over the Monte Cavallo, home.</p>

<p><i>23.</i>&mdash;Last night we had a numerous party, and Signor P. and his
daughter came to sing. <i>She</i> is a private singer of great talent, and
came attended by her lover or her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>; who, according to Italian
custom, attends his mistress every where during the few weeks which
precede their marriage. He is a young artist, a favourite pupil of
Camuccini, and of very quiet, unobtrusive manners. La P. has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
misfortune to be plain; her features are irregular, her complexion of
a sickly paleness, and though her eyes are large and dark, they appeared
totally devoid of lustre and expression. Her plainness, the bad taste of her
dress, her awkward figure, and her timid and embarrassed deportment,
all furnished matter of amusement and observation to some young people,
(English of course,) whose propensities for <i>quizzing</i> exceeded their good
breeding and good nature. Though La P. does not understand a word
of either French or English, I thought she could not mistake the significant
looks and whispers of which she was the object, and I was in
pain for her, and for her modest lover. I drew my chair to the piano,
and tried to divert her attention by keeping her in conversation,
but I could get no farther than a few questions which were answered
in monosyllables. At length she sang&mdash;and sang divinely: I found
the pale automaton had a soul as well as a voice. After giving us, with
faultless execution, as well as great expression, some of Rossini's finest
songs, she sung the beautiful and difficult cavatina in Otello, "<i>Assisa
al pi&egrave; d'un Salice</i>," with the most enchanting style and pathos, and
then stood as unmoved as a statue while the company applauded loud
and long. A moment afterwards, as she stooped to take up a music
book, her lover, who had edged himself by degrees from the door to
the piano, bent his head too, and murmured in a low voice, but with
the most passionate accent, "O brava, brava cara!" She replied
only by a look&mdash;but it was such a look! I never saw a human countenance
so entirely, so instantaneously changed in character: the
vacant eyes kindled and beamed with tenderness: the pale cheek
glowed, and a bright smile playing round her mouth, just parted her
lips sufficiently to discover a set of teeth like pearls. I could have
called her at that moment beautiful; but the change was as transient
as sudden&mdash;it passed like a gleam of light over her face and vanished,
and by the time the book was placed on the desk, she looked as plain,
as stupid, and as statue-like as ever. I was the only person who had
witnessed this little by-scene; and it gave me pleasant thoughts and
interest for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>Another trait of character occurred afterwards, which amused me,
but in a very different style. Our new Danish friend, the Baron
B&mdash;&mdash;, told us he had once been present at the decapitation of nine
men, having first fortified himself with a large goblet of brandy.
After describing the scene in all its horrible details, and assuring us
in his bad German French that it was "<i>une chose bien mauvaise &agrave;
voir</i>," I could not help asking him with a shudder, how he felt afterwards;
whether it was not weeks or months before the impressions
of horror left his mind? He answered with smiling na&iuml;vet&eacute; and
taking a pinch of snuff, "<i>Ma foi! madame, je n'ai pas pu manger
de la viande toute cette journ&eacute;e-l&agrave;?</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>27.</i>&mdash;We drove to the Palazzo Spada, to see the famous Spada
Pompey, said to be the very statue at the base of which C&aelig;sar fell.
I was pleased to find, contrary to my expectations, that this statue
has great intrinsic merit, besides its celebrity, to recommend it. The
extremities of the limbs have a certain clumsiness which may perhaps
be a feature of resemblance, and not a fault of the sculptor; but the
attitude is noble, and the likeness of the head to the undisputed bust
of Pompey in the Florentine gallery, struck me immediately. The
Palazza Spada, with its splendid architecture, dirt, discomfort, and
dilapidation, is a fair specimen of the Roman palaces in general. It
contains a corridor, which from an architectural deception appears
much longer than it really is. I hate tricks&mdash;in architecture especially.
We afterwards visited the Pantheon, the Church of Santa
Maria sopra Minerva, (an odd combination of names,) and concluded
the morning at Canova's. It is one of the pleasures of Rome to lounge
in the studj of the best sculptors; and it is at Rome only that sculpture
seems to flourish as in its native soil. Rome is truly the <i>city of the
soul</i>, the home of art and artists. With the divine models of the
Vatican ever before their eyes, these inspiring skies above their heads,
and the quarries of marble at a convenient distance&mdash;it is here only
they can conceive and execute those works which are formed from
the <i>beau-id&eacute;al</i>; but it is not here they meet with patronage: the
most beautiful things I have seen at the various studj have all been
executed for English, German, and Russian noblemen. The names
I heard most frequently were those of the Dukes of Bedford and Devonshire,
Prince Esterhazy, and the King of England.</p>

<p>Canova has been accused of a want of simplicity, and of giving a
too voluptuous expression to some of his figures: with all my admiration
of his genius, I confess the censure just. It is particularly observable
in the Clori svegliata (the Nymph awakened by Love), the
Cupid and Psyche, for Prince Yousouppoff, the Endymion, the Graces,
and some others.</p>

<p>In some of Thorwaldson's works there is exquisite grace, simplicity,
and expression: the Shepherd Boy, the Adonis, the Jason, and
the Hebe, have a great deal of antique spirit. I did not like the
colossal Christ which the sculptor has just finished in clay: it is a
proof that bulk alone does not constitute sublimity: it is deficient in
dignity, or rather in <i>divinity</i>.</p>

<p>At Rodolf Schadow's, I was most pleased by the Cupid and the
Filatrice. His Cupid is certainly the most beautiful Cupid I ever
saw, superior, I think, both to Canova's and to Thorwaldson's. The
Filatrice, though so exquisitely natural and graceful, a little disappointed
me; I had heard much of it, and had formed in my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
imagination an idea different and superior to what I saw. This beautiful
figure has repose, simplicity, nature, and grace, but I felt a <i>want</i>&mdash;the
want of some internal sentiment: for instance, if, instead of
watching the rotation of her spindle with such industrious attention,
the Filatrice had looked careless, or absent, or pensive, or disconsolate,
(like Faust's Margaret at her spinning-wheel,) she would have
been more interesting&mdash;but not perhaps what the sculptor intended to
represent.</p>

<p>Schadow is ill, but we were admitted by his order into his private
study; we saw there the Bacchante, which he has just finished in clay,
and which is to emulate or rival Canova's Dansatrice. He has been
at work upon a small but beautiful figure of a piping Shepherd-boy,
which is just made out: beside it lay Virgil's Eclogues, and his
spectacles were between the leaves.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>Almost every thing I saw at Max Laboureur's struck me as vapid
and finikin. There were some pretty groups, but nothing to tempt
me to visit it again.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>30.</i>&mdash;We spent the whole morning at the Villa Albani, where there
is a superb collection of antique marbles, most of them brought from
the Villa of Adrian at Tivoli. To note down even a few of the objects
which pleased me would be an endless task. I think the busts interested
me most. There is a basso-relievo of Antinous&mdash;the beautiful
head declined in his usual pensive attitude: it is the most finished
and faultless piece of sculpture in relievo I ever saw; and as perfect
and as polished as if it came from the chisel yesterday. There is
another basso-relievo of Marcus Aurelius, and Faustina, equal to the
last in execution, but not in interest.</p>

<p>We found Rogers in the gardens: the old poet was sunning himself&mdash;walking
up and down a beautiful marble portico, lined with works
of art, with his note-book in his hand. I am told he is now writing
a poem of which Italy is the subject; and here, with all the Campagna
di Roma spread out before him&mdash;above him, the sunshine and the
cloudless skies&mdash;and all around him, the remains of antiquity in a
thousand elegant, or venerable, or fanciful forms: he could not have
chosen a more genial spot for inspiration. Though we disturbed his
poetical reveries rather abruptly, he met us with his usual amiable
courtesy, and conversed most delightfully. I never knew him more
pleasant, and never saw him so animated.</p>

<p>Our departure from Rome has been postponed from day to day in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
consequence of a <i>trifling</i> accident. An Austrian colonel was taken
by the banditti near Fondi, and carried up into the mountains: ten
thousand scudi were demanded for his ransom; and for many days
past, the whole city has been in a state of agitation and suspense about
his ultimate fate. The Austrians, roused by the insult, sent a large
body of troops (some say three thousand men) against about one hundred
and fifty robbers, threatening to exterminate them. They were
pursued so closely, that after dragging their unfortunate captive over
the mountains from one fastness to another, till he was nearly dead
from exhaustion and ill-treatment, they either abandoned or surrendered
him without terms. The troops immediately marched back to
Naples, and the matter rests here: I cannot learn that any thing farther
will be done. The robbers being at present panic-struck by such unusual
energy and activity, and driven from their accustomed haunts, by
these valorous champions of good order and good policy, it is considered
that the road is now more open and safe than it has been for
some time, and if nothing new happens to alarm us, we set off on
Friday next.</p>

<p>I visited to-day the baths of Dioclesian, and the noble church which
Michel Angelo has constructed upon, and out of, their gigantic ruins.
It has all that grand simplicity, that <i>entireness</i> which characterizes his
works: it contains, too, some admirable pictures. On leaving the
church, I saw on each side of the door, the monuments of Salvator Rosa
and Carlo Maratti&mdash;what a contrast do they exhibit in their genius, in
their works, in their characters, in their countenances, in their lives!
Near this church (the Santa Maria dei Angeli) is the superb fountain
of the Acqua Felice, the first view of which rather disappointed me.
I had been told that it represented Moses striking the rock,&mdash;a magnificent
idea for a fountain! but the execution falls short of the conception.
The water, instead of gushing from the rock, is poured out
from the mouths of two prodigious lions of basalt, brought, I believe,
from Upper Egypt: they seem misplaced here. A little beyond the
Ponta Pia is the Campo Scelerato, where the Vestals were interred
alive. We afterwards drove to the Santi Apostoli to see the tomb of
the excellent Ganganelli, by Canova. Then to Sant' Ignazio, to see
the famous ceiling painted in perspective by the jesuit Pozzo. The
effect is certainly marvellous, making the interior appear to the eye,
at least twice the height it really is; but though the illusion pleased me
as a work of art, I thought the trickery unnecessary and misplaced. At
the magnificent church of the Gesuiti (where there are two entire columns
of giallo antico) I saw a list of relics for which the church is
celebrated, and whose efficacy and sanctity were vouched for by a very
respectable catalogue of miracles. Among these relics there are a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
worth mentioning for their oddity, viz. one of the Virgin's <i>shifts</i>, three
of her hairs, and the skirt of Joseph's coat.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>31.</i>&mdash;We spent nearly the whole day in the gallery of the Vatican,
and in the Pauline and Sistine chapels.</p>

<p><i>February 1st, at Valletri.</i>&mdash;I left Rome this morning exceedingly
depressed: Madame de Sta&euml;l may well call travelling <i>un triste plaisir</i>.
My depression did not arise from the feeling that I left behind me any
thing or any person to regret, but from mixed and melancholy emotions,
and partly perhaps from that weakness which makes my hand
tremble while I write&mdash;which has bound down my mind, and all its
best powers, and all its faculties of enjoyment, to a languid passiveness,
making me feel at every moment, I am not what I was, or
ought to be, or might have been.</p>

<p>We arrived, after a short and most delightful journey by Albano,
the Lake Nemi, Gensao, etc. at Velletri, the birth-place of that wretch
Octavius, and famous for its wine. The day has been as soft and as
sunny as a May-day in England, and the country, through which we
travelled but too rapidly, beyond description lovely. The blue Mediterranean
spread far to the west, and on the right we had the snowy
mountains, with their wild fantastic peaks "rushing on the sky." I
felt it all in my heart with a mixture of sadness and delight which I
cannot express.</p>

<p>This land was made by nature a paradise: it seems to want no
charm, "unborrowed from the eye,"&mdash;but how has memory sanctified,
history illustrated, and poetry illumined the scenes around us;
where every rivulet had its attendant nymph, where every wood was
protected by its sylvan divinity; where every tower has its tale of
heroism, and "not a mountain lifts its head unsung;" and though the
faith, the glory, and the power of the antique time be passed away&mdash;still</p>

<p>I can allow that one-half, at least, of the beauty and interest we see,
lies in our own souls; that it is our own enthusiasm which sheds this
mantle of light over all we behold: but, as colours do not exist in the
objects themselves, but in the rays which paint them&mdash;so beauty is not
less real, is not less <span class="smcap">beauty</span>, because it exists in the medium through
which we view certain objects, rather than in those objects themselves.
I have met persons who think they display a vast deal of common
sense, and very uncommon strength of mind, in rising superior to all
prejudices of education and illusions of romance&mdash;to whom <a name="enthusiasm" id="enthusiasm"></a>enthusiasm
is only another name for affectation&mdash;who, where the cultivated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the contemplative mind finds ample matter to excite feeling and reflection,
give themselves airs of fashionable <i>nonchalance</i>, or flippant
scorn&mdash;to whom the crumbling ruin is so much brick and mortar, no more&mdash;to
whom the tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii is a <i>stack of chimneys</i>,
the Pantheon <i>an old oven</i>, and the Fountain of Egeria a <i>pig-sty</i>. Are
such persons aware that in all this there is an affectation, a thousand
times more gross and contemptible, than that affectation (too frequent
perhaps) which they design to ridicule?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><i>2.</i>&mdash;Our journey to-day has been long, but delightfully diversified,
and abounding in classical beauty and interest. I scarce know what
to say, now that I open my little book to record my own sensations:
they are so many, so various, so painful, so delicious&mdash;my senses and
my imagination have been so enchanted, my heart so very heavy&mdash;where
shall I begin?</p>

<p>In some of the scenes of to-day&mdash;at Terracina, particularly, there
was beauty beyond what I ever beheld or imagined: the scenery of
Switzerland is of a different character, and on a different scale: it is
beyond comparison grander, more gigantic, more overpowering, but
it is not so poetical. Switzerland is not Italy&mdash;is not the enchanting
<i>south</i>. This soft balmy air, these myrtles, orange-groves, palm-trees;
these cloudless skies, this bright blue sea, and sunny hills, all breathe
of an enchanted land; "a land of Faery."</p>

<p>Between Velletri and Terracina the road runs in one undeviating line
through the Pontine Marshes. The accounts we have of the baneful
effects of the malaria here, and the absolute solitude, (not a human face
or a human habitation intervening from one post-house to another,)
invest the wild landscape with a frightful and peculiar character of
desolation. As for the mere exterior of the country, I have seen more
wretched and sterile looking spots, (in France, for instance,) but none
that so affected the imagination and the spirits. On leaving the Pontine
Marshes, we came almost suddenly upon the sunny and luxuriant
region near Terracina: here was the ancient city of Anxur; and the
gothic ruins of the castle of Theodoric, which frown on the steep
above, are contrasted with the delicate and Grecian proportions of the
temple below. All the country round is famed in classic and poetic
lore. The Promontory (once poetically the <i>island</i>) of Circe is still
the Monte Circello: here was the region of the Lestrygons, and the
scene of part of the &AElig;neid and Odyssey; and Corinne has superadded
romantic and charming associations quite as delightful, and quite as
<i>true</i>.</p>

<p>Antiquarians, who, like politicians, "seem to see the things that are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
not," have placed all along this road, the sites of many a celebrated
town and fane&mdash;"making hue and cry after many a city which has run
away, and by certain marks and tokens pursuing to find it:" as some
old author says so quaintly. At every hundred yards, fragments of
masonry are seen by the road-side; portions of brickwork, sometimes
traced at the bottom of a dry ditch, or incorporated into a fence; sometimes
peeping above the myrtle bushes on the wild hills, where the
green lizards lie basking and glittering on them in thousands, and the
stupid ferocious buffalo, with his fierce red eyes, rubs his hide and glares
upon us as we pass. No&mdash;not the grandest monuments of Rome&mdash;not
the Coliseum itself, in all its decaying magnificence, ever inspired me
with such profound emotions as did those nameless, shapeless vestiges
of the dwellings of man, starting up like memorial tombs in the midst
of this savage but luxuriant wilderness. Of the beautiful cities which
rose along this lovely coast, the colonies of elegant and polished Greece&mdash;one
after another swallowed up by the "insatiate maw" of ancient
Rome, nothing remains&mdash;their sites, their very names have passed
away and perished. We might as well hunt after a forgotten dream.</p>

<p>I write this a Ga&euml;ta&mdash;a name famous in the poetical, the classical,
the military story of Italy, from the day of &AElig;neas, from whom it received
its appellation, down to the annals of the late war. On the site
of our inn, (the Albergo di Cicerone,) stood Cicero's Formian Villa;
and in an adjoining grove he was murdered in his litter by the satellites
of the Triumviri, as he attempted to escape. I stood to-night on a little
terrace, which hung over an orange grove, and enjoyed a scene which
I would paint, if words were forms, and hues, and sounds&mdash;not else. A
beautiful bay, enclosed by the Mola di Ga&euml;ta, on one side, and the Promontory
of Misenum on the other: the sky studded with stars and reflected
in a sea as blue as itself&mdash;and so glassy and unruffled, it seemed
to slumber in the moonlight: now and then the murmur of a wave,
not hoarsely breaking on rock and shingles, but kissing the turfy shore,
where oranges and myrtles grew down to the water edge. These, and
the remembrances connected with all, and a mind to think, and a heart
to feel, and thoughts both of pain and pleasure mingling to render the
effect more deep and touching.&mdash;Why should I write this? O surely
I need not fear that I shall <i>forget</i>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Naples. Sunday 3rd.</i>&mdash;We left Ga&euml;ta early. If the scene was
so beautiful in the evening&mdash;how bright, how lovely it was this morning!
The sun had not long risen; and a soft purple mist hung over
part of the sea; while to the north and west the land and water sparkled
and glowed in the living light. Some little fishing boats which had
just put off, rocked upon the glassy sea, which lent them a gentle
motion, though itself appeared all mirror-like and motionless. The
orange and lemon trees in full foliage literally bent over the water; and
it was so warm at half past eight that I felt their shade a relief.</p>

<p>After leaving Ga&euml;ta, the first place of note is or <i>was</i> Minturnum,
where Marius was taken, concealed in the marshes near it. The
marshes remain, the city has disappeared. Capua is still a large town;
but it certainly does not keep up its ancient fame for luxury and good
cheer: for we found it extremely difficult to procure any thing to eat.
The next town is Avversa, a name unknown, I believe, in the classical
history of Italy: it was founded, if I remember rightly, by the Norman
knights. Near this place is or was the convent where Queen Joanna
strangled her husband Andrea, with a silken cord of her own weaving.
So says the story: <i>non lo credo io</i>.</p>

<p>From Avversa to Naples the country is not interesting; but fertile
and rich beyond description: an endless succession of vineyards and
orange groves. At length we reached Naples; all tired and in a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>particularly
sober and serious mood: we remembered it was the Sabbath,
and had forgotten that it was the first day of the Carnival; and great
was our amazement at the scene which met us on our arrival&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I looked, I stared, I smiled, I laughed: and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weight of sadness was in wonder lost.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The whole city seemed one vast puppet-show; and the noisy gaiety
of the crowded streets almost stunned me. One of the first objects
we encountered was a barouche full of Turks and Sultanas, driven by
an old woman in a tawdry court dress as coachman; while a merry-andrew
and a harlequin capered behind as footmen. Owing to the immense
size of the city, and the difficulty of making our way through the
motley throng of masks, beggars, lazzaroni, eating-stalls, carts and
carriages, we were nearly three hours traversing the streets before we
reached our inn on the Chiaja.</p>

<p>I feel tired and over-excited: I have been standing on my balcony
looking out upon the moonlit bay, and listening to the mingled shouts,
the laughter, the music all around me; and thinking&mdash;till I feel in no
mood to write.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>7.</i>&mdash;Last night we visited the theatre of San Carlo. It did not strike
me as equal to the Scala at Milan. The form is not so fine, the extent
of the stage is, or appeared to be, less; but there is infinitely more
gilding and ornament; the mirrors and lights, the sky-blue draperies
produce a splendid effect, and the coup-d'&#339;il is, on the whole, more
gay, more theatre-like. It was crowded in every part, and many of
the audience were in dominos and fancy dresses: a few were masked.
Rossini's Barbiere di Seviglia, which contains, I think more <i>melody</i>
than all his other operas put together, (the Tancredi perhaps excepted,)
was most enchantingly sung, and as admirably acted; and the beautiful
classical ballet of "Niobe and her Children," would have appeared
nothing short of perfection, had I not seen the Didone Abbandonata at
Milan. But they have no actress here like the graceful, the expressive
Pallerini; nor any actor equal to the &AElig;neas of the Scala.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>The Austrians, who are paramount here, allow masks only twice a
week, Sundays and Thursdays. The people seem determined to indemnify
themselves for this restriction on their pleasures by every
allowed excess during the two days of merriment, which their despotic
conquerors have spared them. I am told by M** and S**, our
Italian friends, that the Carnival is now fallen off from its wild spirit of
fanciful gaiety; that it is stupid, dull, tasteless, in comparison to what it
was formerly, owing to the severity of the Austrian police. I know
nothing about the propriety of the measures which have been resorted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to for curbing the excesses of the Carnival: I think if people <i>will</i> run
away instead of fighting for their national rights, they must be content
to suffer accordingly&mdash;but I meddle not with politics, and with all my
heart abhor them. Whatever the gaities of the Carnival may have
been formerly, it is scarce possible to conceive a more fantastic, a more
picturesque, a more laughable scene than the Strada di Toledo exhibited
to-day; the whole city seemed to wear "one universal grin;"
and such an incessant fire of sugar-plums (or what seemed such) was
carried on, and with such eagerness and mimic fury, that when our carriage
came out of the conflict, we all looked as if a sack of flour had been
shaken over us. The implements used in this ridiculous warfare, are,
for common purposes, little balls of plaster of Paris and flour, made to
resemble small comfits: friends and acquaintances pelted each other
with real confetti, and those of the most delicious and expensive kinds.
A double file of carriages moved in a contrary direction along the
Corso; a space in the middle and on each side being left for horsemen
and pedestrians, and the most exact order was maintained by the guards
and police; so that if by chance a carriage lost its place in the line it
was impossible to recover it, and it was immediately obliged to leave
the street, and re-enter by one of the extremities. Besides the warfare
carried on below, the balconies on each side were crowded with people
in gay or grotesque dresses, who had <i>sacks</i> of bon-bons before them,
from which they showered vollies upon those beneath, or aimed across
the street at each other: some of them filled their handkerchiefs, and
then dexterously loosening the corners, and taking a certain aim, flung
a volley at once. This was like a cannon loaded with grape-shot, and
never failed to do the most terrific execution.</p>

<p>Among the splendid and fanciful equipages of the masqueraders,
was one, containing the Duke of Monteleone's family, in the form of
a ship, richly ornamented, and drawn by six horses mounted by masks
for postilions. The fore part of the vessel contained the Duke's party,
dressed in various gay costumes, as Tartar warriors and Indian queens.
In the stern were the servants and attendants, <i>travestied</i> in the most
grotesque and ludicrous style. This magnificent and unwieldly car
had by some chance lost its place in the procession, and vainly endeavoured
to whip in; as it is a point of honour among the charioteers
not to yield the <i>pas</i>. Our coachman, however, was ordered (though
most unwilling) to draw up and make way for it; and this little civility
was acknowledged, not only by a profusion of bows, but by such a
shower of delicious sugar plums, that the seats of our carriage were
literally covered with them, and some of the gentlemen flung into our
laps elegant little baskets, fastened with ribbons, and filled with exquisite
sweetmeats. I could not enter into all this with much spirit;
"<i>non son io quel ch'un tempo fui:</i>" but I was an amused, though a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
quiet spectator; and sometimes saw much more than those who were
actually engaged in the battle. I observed that to-day our carriage
became an object of attention, and a favourite point of attack to several
parties on foot, and in carriages; and I was at no loss to discover the
reason. I had with me a lovely girl, whose truly English style of
beauty, her brilliant bloom, heightened by her eager animation, her
lips dimpled with a thousand smiles, and her whole countenance
radiant with glee and mischievous archness, made her an object of
admiration, which the English expressed by a fixed stare, and the
Italians by sympathetic smiles, nods, and all the usual superlatives of
delight. Among our most potent and malignant adversaries, was a
troop of elegant masks in a long open carriage, the form of which was
totally concealed by the boughs of laurel, and wreaths of artificial
flowers, with which it was covered. It was drawn by six fine horses,
fancifully caparisoned, ornamented with plumes of feathers, and led by
grotesque masks. In the carriage stood twelve persons in black silk
dominos, black hats, and black masks; with plumes of crimson feathers,
and rich crimson sashes. They were armed with small painted targets
and tin tubes, from which they shot vollies of confetti, in such quantities,
and with such dexterous aim, that we were almost overwhelmed
whenever we passed them. It was in vain we returned the compliment;
our small shot rattled on their masks, or bounded from their
shields, producing only shouts of laughter at our expense.</p>

<p>A favourite style of mask here, is the dress of an English sailor,
straw hats, blue jackets, white trowsers, and very white masks with
pink cheeks: we saw hundreds in this whimsical costume.</p>

<p><i>13.</i>&mdash;On driving home rather late this evening, and leaving the
noise, the crowds, the confusion and festive folly of the Strada di
Toledo, we came suddenly upon a scene, which, from its beauty, no
less than by the force of contrast, strongly impressed my imagination.
The shore was silent, and almost solitary: the bay as smooth as a
mirror, and as still as a frozen lake; the sky, the sea, the mountains
round were all of the same hue, a soft grey tinged with violet, except
where the sunset had left a narrow crimson streak along the edge of
the sea. There was not a breeze, not the slightest breath of air, and
a single vessel, a frigate with all its white sails crowded, lay motionless
as a monument on the bosom of the waters, in which it was reflected
as in a mirror. I have seen the bay more splendidly beautiful; but
I never saw so peculiar, so lovely a picture. It lasted but a short
time: the transparent purple veil became a dusky pall, and night and
shadow gradually enveloped the whole.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>How I love these resplendent skies and blue seas! Nature here
seems to celebrate a continual Festa, and to be for ever decked out in
holiday costume! A drive along the "<i>sempre beata Mergellina</i>" to
the extremity of the Promontory of Pausilippo is positive enchantment:
thence we looked over a landscape of such splendid and unequalled
interest! the shores of Baia, where Cicero, Horace, Virgil, Pliny,
Mec&aelig;nas, lived; the white towers of Puzzuoli and the Islands of Ischia,
Procida, and Nisida. There was the Sybil's Cave, Lake Acheron, and the
fabled Lethe; there the sepulchre of Misenus, who defied the Triton;
and the scene of the whole sixth book of the &AElig;neid, which I am now
reading in Annibal Caro's translation: there Agrippina mourned Germanicus;
and there her daughter fell a victim to her monster of a son.
At our feet lay the lovely little Island of Nisida, the spot on which
Brutus and Portia parted for the last time before the battle of Philippi.</p>

<p>To the south of the bay the scenery is not less magnificent, and scarcely
less dear to memory: Naples, rising from the sea like an amphitheatre
of white palaces, and towers, and glittering domes: beyond, Mount
Vesuvius, with the smoke curling from its summits like a silver cloud,
and forming the only speck upon the intense blue sky; along its base
Portici, Annunziata, Torre del Greco, glitter in the sun; every white
building&mdash;almost every window in every building, distinct to the eye
at the distance of several miles: farther on, and perched like white
nests on the mountainous promontory, lie Castel a Mare, and Sorrento,
the birth-place of Tasso, and his asylum when the injuries of his cold-hearted
persecutors had stung him to madness, and drove him here
for refuge to the arms of his sister. Yet, farther on, Capua rises from
the sea, a beautiful object in itself, but from which the fancy gladly
turns to dwell again upon the snowy buildings of Sorrento.</p>

<p>This is the last day of the Carnival, the last night of the opera; the
people are permitted to go in masks, and after the performances there
will be a ball. To-day, when Baldi was describing the excesses
which usually take place during the last few hours of the Carnival, he
said, "the man who has but half a shirt will pawn it to-night to buy
a good supper and an opera-ticket: to-morrow for fish and soup-maigre&mdash;fasting
and repentance!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Saturday, 23.</i>&mdash;I have just seen a most magnificent sight; one
which I have often dreamed of, often longed to behold, and having
beheld, never shall forget. Mount Vesuvius is at this moment blazing
like a huge furnace; throwing up every minute, or half minute,
columns of fire and red-hot stones, which fall in showers and bound
down the side of the mountain. On the east, there are two distinct
streams of lava descending, which glow with almost a white heat, and
every burst of flame is accompanied by a sound resembling cannon at
a distance.&mdash;</p>

<p>I can hardly write, my mind is so overflowing with astonishment,
admiration, and sublime pleasure: what a scene as I looked out on
the bay from the Sante Lucia! On one side, the evening star and the
thread-like crescent of the new moon were setting together over Pausilippo,
reflected in lines of silver radiance on the blue sea; on the
other the broad train of fierce red light glared upon the water with a
fitful splendour, as the explosions were more or less violent: before me
all was so soft, so lovely, so tranquil! while I had only to turn my
head to be awe-struck by the convulsion of fighting elements.</p>

<p>I remember, that on our first arrival at Naples, I was disappointed
because Vesuvius did not smoke so much as I had been led to expect
from pictures and descriptions. The smoke then lay like a scarcely
perceptible cloud on the highest point, or rose in a slender white column;
to-day and yesterday, it has rolled from the crater in black
volumes, mixing with the clouds above, and darkening the sky.</p>

<p><i>Half-past twelve.</i>&mdash;I have walked out again: the blaze from the
crater is less vivid; but there are now four streams of lava issuing from
it, which have united in two broad currents, one of which extends below
the hermitage. It is probable that by to-morrow night it will
have reached the lower part of the mountain.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 24.</i>&mdash;Just returned from chapel at the English ambassador's,
where the service was read by a dandy clergyman to a crowd of fine
and superfine ladies and gentlemen, crushed together into a hot room.
I never saw extravagance in dress carried to such a pitch as it is by my
countrywomen here,&mdash;whether they dress at the men or against each
other, it is equally bad taste. The sermon to-day was very appropriate,
from the text, "<i>Take ye no thought what ye shall eat, or what
ye shall drink, or what ye shall put on</i>," and, I dare say, it was listened
to with singular edification.</p>

<p><i>5 o'clock.</i>&mdash;We have been driving along the Strada Nuova in L**'s
britschka, whence we had a fine view of Vesuvius. There are tremendous
bursts of smoke from the crater. At one time the whole mountain,
down to the very base, was almost enveloped, and the atmosphere
round it loaded with the vapour, which seemed to issue in volumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
half as large as the mountain itself. If horses are to be had we go up
to-night.</p>

<p><i>Monday night.</i>&mdash;I am not in a humour to describe, or give way to
any poetical flights, but I must endeavour to give a faithful, sober, and
circumstantial account of our last night's expedition, while the impression
is yet fresh on my mind; though there is, I think, little danger
of my forgetting. We procured horses, which, from the number of
persons proceeding on the same errand with ourselves, was a matter of
some difficulty. We set out at seven in the evening in an open carriage,
and almost the whole way we had the mountain before us,
spouting fire to a prodigious height. The road was crowded with
groups of people who had come out from the city and environs to take
a nearer view of the magnificent spectacle, and numbers were hurrying
to and fro in those little flying <i>corricoli</i> which are peculiar to Naples.
As we approached, the explosions became more and more vivid, and at
every tremendous burst of fire our friend L** jumped half off his seat,
making most loud and characteristic exclamations,&mdash;"By Jove! a
magnificent fellow! now for it, whizz! there he goes, sky high, by
George!" The rest of the party were equally enthusiastic in a different
style; and I sat silent and quiet from absolute inability to express
what I felt. I was almost breathless with wonder, and excitement,
and impatience to be nearer the scene of action. While my eyes were
fixed on the mountain, my attention was, from time to time, excited
by regular rows of small shining lights, six or eight in number, creeping,
as it seemed, along the edge of the stream of lava; and, when
contrasted with the red blaze which rose behind, and the gigantic black
back-ground, looking like a procession of glowworms. These were the
torches of travellers ascending the mountain, and I longed to be one of
them.</p>

<p>We reached Resina a little before nine, and alighted from the carriage;
the ascent being so rugged and dangerous, that only asses and
mules accustomed to the road are used. Two only were in waiting at
the moment we arrived, which L** immediately secured for me and
himself; and though reluctant to proceed without the rest of the party,
we were compelled to go on before, that we might not lose time, or
hazard the loss of our <i>monture</i>. We set off then, each with two attendants,
a man to lead our animals and a torch-bearer. The road,
as we ascended, became more and more steep at every step, being over
a stream of lava, intermixed with stones and ashes, and the darkness
added to the difficulty. But how shall I describe the scene and the
people who surrounded us; the landscape partially lighted by a fearful
red glare, the precipitous and winding road bordered by wild looking
gigantic aloes, projecting their huge spear-like leaves almost across our
path, and our lazzaroni attendants with their shrill shouts, and strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
dresses, and wild jargon, and striking features, and dark eyes flashing
in the gleam of the torches, which they flung round their heads to prevent
their being extinguished, formed a scene so new, so extraordinary,
so like romance, that my attention was frequently drawn from the
mountain, though blazing in all its tumultuous magnificence.</p>

<p>The explosions succeeded each other with terrific rapidity about two
in every three minutes; and the noise I can only compare to the
roaring and hissing of ten thousand imprisoned winds, mingled at times
with a rumbling sound like artillery, or distant thunder. It frequently
happened that the guides, in dashing their torches against the ground,
set fire to the dried thorns and withered grass, and the blaze ran along
the earth like wildfire, to the great alarm of poor L**, who saw in
every burning bush a stream of lava rushing to overwhelm us.</p>

<p>Before eleven o'clock we reached the Hermitage, situated between
Vesuvius and the Somma, and the highest habitation on the mountain.
A great number of men were assembled within, and guides, lazzaroni,
servants, and soldiers, were lounging round. I alighted, for I was benumbed
and tired, but did not like to venture among those people, and
it was proposed that we should wait for the rest of our party a little
further on. We accordingly left our donkeys and walked forward upon
a kind of high ridge which serves to fortify the Hermitage and its environs
against the lava. From this path, as we slowly ascended, we
had a glorious view of the eruption; and the whole scene around us,
in its romantic interest and terrible magnificence, mocked all power of
description. There were, at this time, five distinct torrents of lava
rolling down like streams of molten lead; one of which extended above
two miles below us and was flowing towards Portici. The showers of
red-hot stones flew up like thousands of sky rockets: many of them
being shot up perpendicularly fell back into the crater, others falling on
the outside bounded down the side of the mountain with a velocity
which would have distanced a horse at full speed: these stones were
of every size, from two to ten or twelve feet in diameter.</p>

<p>My ears were by this time wearied and stunned by the unceasing
roaring and hissing of the flames, while my eyes were dazzled by the
glare of the red, fierce light: now and then I turned them for relief
to other features of the picture, to the black shadowy masses of the
landscape stretched beneath us, and speckled with shining lights, which
showed how many were up and watching that night; and often to the
calm vaulted sky above our heads, where thousands of stars (not
twinkling as through our hazy or frosty atmosphere, but shining out
of "heaven's profoundest azure," with that soft steady brilliance peculiar
to a highly rarified medium) looked down upon this frightful
turmoil in all their bright and placid loveliness. Nor should I forget
one other feature of a scene, on which I looked with a painter's eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Great numbers of the Austrian forces, now occupying Naples, were on
the mountains, assembled in groups, some standing, some sitting, some
stretched on the ground and wrapped in their cloaks, in various attitudes
of amazement and admiration: and as the shadowy glare fell
on their tall martial figures and glittering accoutrements, I thought I
had never beheld any thing so wildly picturesque.</p>

<p>The remainder of our party not yet appearing, we sent back for our
asses and guides, and determined to proceed. About half a mile
beyond, our companions came up, and here a division took place; some
agreeing to go forward, the rest turning back to wait at the Hermitage.
I was of course one of those who advanced. My spirits were again
raised, and the grand object of all this daring and anxiety was to approach
near enough to a stream of lava to have some idea of its consistency,
and the manner in which it flowed, or trickled down. The
difficulties of our road now increased, "if <i>road</i> that might be called,
which road was none," but black loose ashes, and masses of scoria and
lava heaped in ridges, or broken into hollows in a manner not to be
described. Even my animal, though used to the path, felt his footing
at every step, and if the torch was by accident extinguished, he stopped,
and nothing could make him move. My guide, Andrea, was very
vigilant and attentive, and, in the few words of Italian he knew, encouraged
me, and assured me there was no danger. I had, however,
no fear: in fact, I was infinitely too much interested to have been
alive to danger, had it really existed. Salvador, well known to all
who have visited Mount Vesuvius, had been engaged by Mr. R. as his
guide. He is the principal cicerone on the mountain. It is his business
to despatch to the king every three hours, a regular account of
the height of the eruption, the progress, extent, and direction of the
lava, and, in short, the most minute particulars. He also corresponds,
as he assured me, with Sir Humphry Davy;<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> and is employed to
inform him of every interesting phenomenon which takes place on the
mountain. This man has resided at the foot of it, and been principal
guide, for thirty-three years, and knows every inch of its territory.</p>

<p>As the lava had overflowed the usual footpath leading to that conical
eminence which forms the summit of the mountain and the exterior of
the crater, we were obliged to alight from our sagacious steeds; and,
trusting to our feet, walked over the ashes for about a quarter of a
mile. The path, or the ground rather, for there was no path, was
now dangerous to the inexperienced foot; and Salvador gallantly took
me under his peculiar care. He led me on before the rest, and I followed
with confidence. Our object was to reach the edge of a stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of lava, formed of two currents united in a point. It was glowing
with an intense heat; and flowing, not with such rapidity as to alarm
us, but rather slowly, and by fits and starts. <i>Trickling</i>, in short, is
the word which expresses its motion: if one can fancy it applied to
any object on so large a scale.</p>

<p>At this time the eruption was at its extreme height. The column
of fire was from a quarter to a third of a mile high; and the stones
were thrown up to the height of a mile and a quarter. I passed close
to a rock about four feet in diameter, which had rolled down some
time before: it was still red-hot, and I stopped to warm my hands at
it. At a short distance from it lay another stone or rock, also red-hot,
but six times the size. I walked on first with Salvador, till we were
within a few yards of the lava&mdash;at this moment a prodigious stone, followed
by two or three smaller ones, came rolling down upon us with
terrific velocity. The gentlemen and guides all ran; my first impulse
was to run too; but Salvador called on me to stop and see what
direction the stone would take. I saw the reason of this advice, and
stopped. In less than a second he seized my arm and hurried me
back five or six yards. I heard the whizzing sound of the stone as
it rushed down behind me. A little further on it met with an impediment,
against which it bolted with such force, that it flew up into the
air to a great height, and fell in a shower of red-hot fragments. All
this passed in a moment; I have shuddered since when I thought of
that moment; but at the time, I saw the danger without the slightest
sensation of terror. I remember the ridiculous figures of the men, as
they scrambled over the ridges of scoria; and was struck by Salvador's
exclamation, who shouted to them in a tone which would have become
C&aelig;sar himself,&mdash;"Che tema!&mdash;Sono Salvador!"<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>We did not attempt to turn back again: which I should have done
without any hesitation if any one had proposed it. To have come thus
far, and be so near the object I had in view, and then to run away at
the first alarm! It was a little provoking. The road was extremely
dangerous in the descent. I was obliged to walk part of the way, as
the guides advised, and but for Salvador, and the interesting information
he gave me from time to time, I think I should have been overpowered.
He amused and fixed my attention, by his intelligent conversation,
his assiduity, and solicitude for my comfort, and the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>
and self-complacency with which his information was conveyed. He
told me he had visited Mount &AElig;tna (<i>en amateur</i>) during the last great
eruption of that mountain, and acknowledged with laudable candour,
that Vesuvius, in its grandest moments, was a mere bonfire in comparison:
the whole cone of Vesuvius, he said, was not larger than some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of the masses of rock he had seen whirled from the crater of Mount
&AElig;tna, and rolling down its sides. He frequently made me stop and
look back: and here I should observe that our guides seemed as
proud of the performances of the mountain, and as anxious to show it
off to the best advantage, as the keeper of a menagerie is of the tricks
of his dancing bear, or the proprietor of "Solomon in all his glory"
of his raree-show. Their enthusiastic shouts and exclamations would
have kept up my interest had it flagged. "O veda, Signora! O bella!
O stupenda!" The last great burst of fire was accompanied by a fresh
overflow of lava, which issued from the crater, on the west side, in
two broad streams, and united a few hundred feet below, taking the
direction of Torre del Greco. After this explosion the eruption subsided,
and the mountain seemed to repose: now and then showers of
stones flew up, but to no great height, and unaccompanied by any
vivid flames. There was a dull red light over the mouth of the crater,
round which the smoke rolled in dense tumultuous volumes, and
then blew off towards the south-west.</p>

<p>After a slow and difficult descent we reached the Hermitage. I was
so exhausted that I was glad to rest for a few minutes. My good friend
Salvador brought me a glass of <i>Lachryma Christi</i> and the leg of a chicken;
and with recruited spirits we mounted our animals and again started.</p>

<p>The descent was infinitely more slow and difficult than the ascent,
and much more trying to the nerves. I had not Salvador at my side,
nor the mountain before me, to beguile me from my fears; at length I
prevailed on one of our attendants, a fine tall figure of a man, to sing to
me; and though he had been up the mountain <i>six</i> times in the course
of the day, he sang delightfully and with great spirit and expression,
as he strided along with his hand upon my bridle, accompanied by a
magnificent rumbling bass from the mountain, which every now and
then drowned the melody of his voice, and made me start. It was
past three when we reached Resina, and nearly five when we got home:
yet I rose this morning at my usual hour, and do not feel much fatigued.
About twelve to-day I saw Mount Vesuvius, looking as
quiet and placid as the first time I viewed it. There was little smoke,
and neither the glowing lava nor the flames were visible in the glare
of the sunshine. The atmosphere was perfectly clear, and as I gazed,
almost misdoubting my senses, I could scarcely believe in the reality
of the tremendous scene I had witnessed but a few hours before.</p>

<p><i>26.</i>&mdash;The eruption burst forth again to-day, and is exceedingly
grand; though not equal to what it was on Sunday night. The smoke
rises from the crater in dense black masses, and the wind having
veered a few points to the southward, it is now driven in the direction
of Naples. At the moment I write this, the skies are obscured by
rolling vapours, and the sun, which is now setting just opposite to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Vesuvius, shines, as I have seen him through a London mist, red, and
shorn of his beams. The sea is angry and discoloured; the day most
oppressively sultry, and the atmosphere thick, sulphureous, and loaded
with an almost impalpable dust, which falls on the paper as I write.</p>

<p><i>March 4.</i>&mdash;We have had delicious weather almost ever since we
arrived at Naples, but these last three days have been perfectly heavenly.
I never saw or felt any thing like the enchantment of the
earth, air, and skies. The mountain has been perfectly still, the atmosphere
without a single cloud, the fresh verdure bursting forth all
around us, and every breeze visits the senses, as if laden with a renovating
spirit of life, and wafted from Elysium. Whoever would truly
enjoy nature, should see her in this delicious land: "o&ugrave; la plus douce
nuit succ&egrave;de au plus beau jour;" for here she seems to keep holiday
all the year round. To stand upon my balcony, looking out upon the
sunshine and the glorious bay; the blue sea, and the pure skies&mdash;and to
feel that indefinite sensation of excitement, that <i>superflu de vie</i>, quickening
every pulse and thrilling through every nerve, is a pleasure peculiar
to this climate, where the mere consciousness of existence is
happiness enough. Then evening comes on, lighted by a moon and
starry heavens, whose softness, richness, and splendour, are not to be
conceived by those who have lived always in the vapoury atmosphere
of England&mdash;dear England! I love, like an Englishwoman, its fireside
enjoyments, and home-felt delights: an English drawing-room,
with all its luxurious comforts&mdash;carpets and hearth-rugs, curtains let
down, sofas wheeled round, and a group of family faces round a blazing
fire, is a delightful picture; but for the languid frame, and the
sick heart, give me this pure elastic air, "redolent of spring;" this
reviving sunshine and all the witchery of these deep blue skies!&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Numbers of people set off post-haste from Rome to see the eruption
of Mount Vesuvius, and arrived here Wednesday and Thursday; just
time enough to be too late. Among them our Roman friend Frattino,
who has afforded me more amusement than all our other acquaintance
together, and deserves a niche in my gallery of characters.</p>

<p>Frattino is a young Englishman, who, if he were in England, would
probably be pursuing his studies at Eton or Oxford, for he is scarce
past the age of boyhood; but having been abroad since he was twelve
years old, and early plunged into active and dissipated life, he is an accomplished
man of fashion, and of the world, with as many airs and
caprices as a spoiled child. He is by far the most <i>beautiful</i> creature
of his sex I ever saw; so like the Antinous, that at Rome he went by
that name. The exquisite regularity of his features, the graceful air of
his head, his <i>antique</i> curls, the faultless proportions of his elegant figure,
make him a <i>thing</i> to be gazed on, as one looks at a statue. Then he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
possesses talents, wit, taste, and information: the most polished and
captivating manners, where he wishes to attract,&mdash;high honour and
generosity, where women are not concerned,&mdash;and all the advantages
attending on rank and wealth: but under this fascinating exterior, I
suspect our Frattino to be a very worthless, as well as a very unhappy
being. While he pleases, he repels me. There is a want of
heart about him, a want of fixed principles&mdash;a degree of profligacy, of
selfishness, of fickleness, caprice and ill-temper, and an excess of vanity,
which all his courtly address and <i>savoir faire</i> cannot hide. What
would be insufferable in another, is in him bearable, and even interesting
and amusing: such is the charm of manner. But all this cannot
last: and I should not be surprised to see Frattino, a few years hence,
emerge from his foreign frippery, throw aside his libertine folly, assume
his seat in the senate, and his rank in British society; and be the
very character he now affects to despise and ridicule&mdash;"a true-bred
Englishman, who rides a thorough-bred horse."</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Our excursion to Pompeii yesterday was "a pic-nic party of pleasure,"
<i>&agrave; l'Anglaise</i>. Now a party of pleasure is proverbially a <i>bore</i>: and
our expedition was in the beginning so unpromising, so mismanaged&mdash;our
party so numerous, and composed of such a heterogeneous mixture
of opposite tempers, tastes, and characters, that I was in pain for the
result. The day, however, turned out more pleasant than I expected:
exterior polish supplied the want of something better, and our excursion
had its pleasures, though they were not such as I should have sought
at Pompeii. I felt myself a simple <i>unit</i> among many, and found it
easier to sympathise with others, than to make a dozen others sympathise
with me.</p>

<p>We were twelve in number, distributed in three light barouches,
and reached Pompeii in about two hours and a half&mdash;passing by the
foot of Vesuvius, through Portici, Torre del Greco, and l'Annonziata.
The streams of lava, which overwhelmed Torre del Greco in 1794, are
still black and barren; but the town itself is rising from its ruins; and
the very lava which destroyed it serves as the material to rebuild it.</p>

<p>We entered Pompeii by the street of the tombs: near them are the
semicircular seats, so admirably adapted for conversation, that I wonder
we have not sofas on a similar plan, and similar scale. I need not dwell
on particulars, which are to be found in every book of travels: on the
whole, my expectations were surpassed, though my curiosity was not
half gratified.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw&mdash;in fact the only thing, for which
paintings and descriptions had not previously prepared me, was a building
which has been excavated within the last fortnight: it is only
partly laid open, and labourers are now at work upon it. Antiquarians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
have not yet pronounced on its name and design; but I should imagine
it to be some public edifice, perhaps dedicated to religious purposes.
The paintings on the walls are the finest which have yet been discovered:
they are exquisitely and tastefully designed; and though executed
merely for <i>effect</i>, that effect is beautiful. I remarked one female figure
in the act of entering a half-open door: she is represented with
pencils and a palette of colours in her hand, similar to those which
artists now use: another very graceful female holds a lyre of peculiar
construction. These, I presume, were two of the muses: the
rest remained hidden. There were two small pannels occupied by
sea-pieces, with gallies; and two charming landscapes, so well coloured,
and drawn with such knowledge of perspective and effect, that
if we may form a comparative idea of the best pictures, from the specimens
of taste and skill in mere house-painting, the ancients must have
excelled us as much in painting as in sculpture. I remarked on the
wall of an entrance or corridor, a dog starting at a wreathed and crested
snake, vividly coloured, and full of spirit and expression. While I
lingered here a little behind the rest, and most reluctant to depart, a
ragged lazzarone boy came up to me, and seizing my dress, pointed to
a corner, and made signs that he had something to show me. I followed
him to a spot where a quantity of dust and ashes was piled
against a wall. He began to scratch away this heap of dirt with hands
and nails, much after the manner of an ape, every now and then looking
up in my face and grinning. The impediment being cleared away, there
appeared on the wall behind, a most beautiful a&euml;rial figure with floating
drapery, representing either Fame or Victory: but before I had time to
examine it, the little rogue flung the earth up again so as to conceal it
completely, then pointing significantly at the other workmen, he nodded,
shrugged, gesticulated, and held out both his paws for a recompense,
which I gave him willingly; at the same time laughing and shaking
my head to show I understood his knavery. I rewarded him apparently
beyond his hopes, for he followed me down the street, bowing,
grinning, and cutting capers like a young savage.</p>

<p>The streets of Pompeii are narrow, the houses are very small, and the
rooms, though often decorated with exquisite taste, are constructed
without any regard to what <i>we</i> should term comfort and convenience;
they are dark, confined, and seldom communicate with each other, but
have a general communication with a portico, running round a central
court. This court is in general beautifully paved with mosaic, having
a fountain or basin in the middle, and possibly answered the purpose
of a drawing-room. It is evident that the ancient inhabitants of this
lovely country lived like their descendants mostly in the open air, and
met together in their public walks, or in the forums, and theatres. If
they <i>saw company</i>, the guests probably assembled under the porticoes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
or in the court round the fountain. The houses seem constructed on
the same principle as birds construct their nests; as places of retreat
and shelter, rather than of assemblage and recreation: the grand object
was to exclude the sunbeams; and this, which gives such gloomy and
chilling ideas in our northern climes, must here have been delicious.</p>

<p>Hurried on by a hungry, noisy, merry party, we at length reached
the Caserna (the ancient barracks, or as Forsyth will have it, the pr&aelig;torium).
The central court of this building has been converted into a
garden: and here, under a weeping willow, our dinner table was spread.
Where Englishmen are, there will be good cheer if possible; and our
banquet was in truth most luxurious. Besides more substantial cates,
we had oysters from Lake Lucrine, and classically excellent they were;
London bottled porter, and half a dozen different kinds of wine. Our
dinner went off most gaily, but no order was kept afterwards: the purpose
of our expedition seemed to be forgotten in general mirth: many
witty things were said and done, and many merry ones, and not a few
silly ones. We visited the beautiful public walk and the platform of
the old temple of Hercules (I call it <i>old</i>, because it was a ruin when
Pompeii was entire); the Temple of Isis, the Theatres, the Forum, the
Basilica, the Amphitheatre, which is in a perfect state of preservation,
and more elliptical in form than any of those I have yet seen, and the
School of Eloquence, where R** mounted the rostrum, and gave us an
oration extempore, equally pithy, classical and comical. About sunset
we got into the carriages, and returned to Naples.</p>

<p>Of all the heavenly days we have had since we came to Naples, this
has been the most heavenly: and of all the lovely scenes I have
beheld in Italy, what I saw to-day has most enchanted my senses and
imagination. The view from the eminence on which the old temple
stood, and which was anciently the public promenade, was splendidly
beautiful, the whole landscape was at one time overflowed with light
and sunshine, and appeared as if seen through an impalpable but dazzling
veil. Towards evening the outlines became more distinct: the
little white towns perched upon the hills, the gentle sea, the fairy
island of Rivegliano with its old tower, the smoking crater of Vesuvius,
the bold forms of Mount Lactarius and Cape Minerva, stood out full
and clear under the cloudless sky: as we returned, I saw the sun
sink behind Capri, which appeared by some optical illusion like a
glorious crimson transparency suspended above the horizon: the sky,
the earth, the sea, were flushed with the richest rose colour, which
gradually softened and darkened into purple: the short twilight faded
away, and the full moon, rising over Vesuvius, lighted up the scenery
with a softer radiance.</p>

<p>Thus ended a day which was not without its pleasures:&mdash;yet had I
planned a party of pleasure to Pompeii, methinks I could have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>managed
better. <i>Par exemple</i>, I would have deferred it a fortnight later,
or till the vines were in leaf; I would have chosen for my companions
two or at most three persons whom I could name, whose cultivated
minds and happy tempers would have heightened their own enjoyment
and mine. After spending a few hours in taking a general view of
the whole city, we would have sat down on the platform of the old
Greek Temple which commands a view of the mountains and the bay;
or, if the heat were too powerful, under the shade of the hill near it.
There we would make our cheerful and elegant repast, on bread and
fruits, and perhaps a bottle of Malvoisie or Champagne: the rest of the
day should be devoted to a minute examination of the principal objects
of interest and curiosity: we would wait till the shadows of evening
had begun to steal over the scene, purpling the mountains and the sea;
we would linger there to enjoy all the splendours of an Italian sunset;
and then, with minds softened and elevated by the loveliness and solemnity
of the scenes around, we would get into our carriage, and drive
back to Naples beneath the bright full moon; and, by the way, we
would "talk the flowing heart," and make our recollections of the
olden time, our deep impressions of the past, heighten our enjoyment
of the present: and this would be indeed a day of <i>pleasure</i>, of such
pleasure as I think I am capable of feeling&mdash;of imparting&mdash;of remembering
with unmixed delight. Such was <i>not</i> yesterday.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>M** brought with him this evening, for our amusement, an old
man, a native of Cento, who gains his livelihood by a curious exhibition
of his peculiar talents. He is blind, and plays well on the violin:
he can recite the whole of the Gerusalemme from beginning to end
without missing a word: he can repeat any given stanza or number of
stanzas either forwards or backwards: he can repeat the last words
one after another of any stanzas: if you give him the first word and
the last, he can name immediately the particular line, stanza, and
book: lastly, he can tell instantly the exact number of words contained
in any given stanza. This exhibition was at first amusing; but as I
soon found that the man's head was a mere machine, that he was
destitute of imagination, and that far from feeling the beauty of the
poet, he did not even understand the meaning of the lines he thus
repeated up and down, and backwards and forwards, it ceased to
interest me after the first sensations of surprise and curiosity were
over.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>After I had read Italian with Signior B** this evening, he amused
me exceedingly by detailing to me the plan of two tragedies he is now
writing or about to write. He has already produced one piece on
the story of Boadicea, which is rather a drama than a regular tragedy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
It was acted here with great success. After giving his drama due
praise, I described to him the plan and characters of Fletcher's Bonduca;
and attempted to give him in Italian some idea of the most
striking scenes of that admirable play: he was alternately in enchantment
and despair, and I thought he would have torn and bitten his
Boadicea to pieces, in the excess of his vivacity.</p>

<p>The subject of one of his tragedies is to be the Sicilian Vespers.
Casimir Delavigne, who wrote <i>Les V&ecirc;pres Siciliennes</i>, which obtained
some years ago such amazing popularity at Paris, and in which the
national vanity of the French is flattered at the expense of the Italians,
received a pension from Louis XVIII. B** spoke with contempt of
Casimir Delavigne's tragedy, and with indignation of what he called
"his wilful misrepresentation of history." He is determined to give
the reverse of the picture: the French will be represented as "<i>gente
crudeli&mdash;tiranni&mdash;oppressori, senza fede</i>;" Giovanni di Procida, as a
hero and patriot, <i>&agrave; l'antique</i>, and the Sicilians as rising in defence of
their freedom and national honour. The other tragedy is to be
founded on the history of the famous <i>Congiura dei Baroni</i> in the reign
of Ferdinand the First, as related by Giannone. The simple facts of
this history need not any ornaments, borrowed from invention or
poetry, to form a most interesting tale, and furnish ample materials
for a beautiful tragedy, in incident, characters, and situations. B**
is a little man, dwarfish and almost deformed in person; but full of
talent, spirit, and enthusiasm. I asked him why he did not immediately
finish these tragedies, which appeared from the sketches he had
given me, so admirably calculated to succeed. He replied, that under
the present regime, he dared not write up to his own conceptions; and
if he curbed his genius, he could do nothing; "Besides," added he
mournfully, "I have no time; I am poor&mdash;poverissimo! I must
work hard all to-day to supply the wants of to-morrow: I am always
surveill&eacute; by the police, as a known liberal and <i>literato</i>."
"<i>Davvero</i>," added he, gaily, "I would soon do, or say, or write
something to attract the honour of their more particular notice, if I
could be certain they would only imprison me for a couple of years,
and ensure me during that time a blanket, bread and water, and the
use of pen and ink: then I would write! I would write! <i>dalla mattina
alla sera</i>; and thank my gaolers as my best friends: but pens
are poignards, ink is poison in the eyes of the present government;
imprisonment for life, or banishment, is the least I could expect. Now
the mere idea of imprisonment for life would kill me in a week, and
banishment!&mdash;<i>Ah lungi dall&aacute; mia bella Patria, come cantare!
come scrivere! come vivere! moriro io anzi nell' momento di
partire!</i>"</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>I drove to-day, t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Laura, to the Lago d'Agnano, about
a mile and a half beyond Pausilippo. This lovely fair lake is not
more than two miles in circuit; and embosomed in romantic woody
hills: innumerable flocks of wild fowl were skimming over its surface,
and gave life and motion to the beautiful but quiet landscape. While
we were wandering here, enjoying the stillness and solitude, so delightfully
contrasted with the unceasing noise, bustle, and crowd of the
city, the charm was rudely broken by the appearance of the king;
who, attended by a numerous party of his guards and huntsmen, had
been wild boar shooting in the neighbouring woods. The waterfowl,
scared by the report of fire arms, speedily disappeared, and the
guards shouted to each other, and galloped round the smooth sloping
banks; cutting up the turf with their horses' hoofs, and deforming the
whole scene with uproar, confusion, and affright. Devoutly did I wish
them all twenty miles off. The famous Grotto del Cane is on the
south bank of the lake, a few yards from the edge of the water. We
saw the torch, when held in the vapour, instantaneously extinguished.
The ground all around the entrance of the grotto is hot to the touch;
and when I plunged my hand into the deleterious gas, which rises
about a foot, or a foot and a half, above the surface of the ground, it
was so warm I was glad to withdraw it. The disagreeable old woman
who showed us this place, brought with her a wretched dog with a
rope round his neck, bleared eyes, thin ribs, and altogether of a most
pitiful aspect. She was most anxious to exhibit the common but
cruel experiment of suspended animation, by holding his head over
the mephitic vapour, insisting that he was accustomed to it, and even
liked it; of course, we would not suffer it. The poor animal made no
resistance; only drooped his head, and put his tail between his legs,
when his tyrant attempted to seize him.</p>

<p>Though now so soft, so lovely, and so tranquil, the Lago d'Agnano
owes its existence to some terrible convulsion of the elements. The
basin is the crater of a sunken volcano, which, bursting forth here,
swallowed up a whole city. And the whole region round, bears evident
marks of its volcanic origin.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>This morning we visited several churches, not one of them worthy
of a remark. The architecture is invariably in the vilest taste; and
the interior decorations, if possible, still worse: white-washing
gilding, and gaudy colours, every where prevail. We saw, however,
some good pictures. At the San Gennaro are the famous frescos of
Domenichino and Lanfranco: the church itself is hideous. At the
Girolomini there is no want of magnificence and ornament; but a
barbarous misapplication of both, as usual. The church of the convent
of Santa Chiara was painted in fresco by Ghiotto: it is now white-washed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
all over. At this church, which I first visited during the
merry days of the carnival, I saw a large figure of our Saviour suspended
on the cross, dressed in a crimson domino, and blue sash. To
what a pitch, thought I, must the love of white-washing and masquerading
be carried in this strange city, where the Deity himself is burlesqued,
and bad taste is carried to profanation! To-day I saw the
same crucifix in a suit of mourning; why should not our South Sea
missionaries come and preach here?</p>

<p>The church of San Severo is falling to ruins, owing to some defect
in the architecture. It is only remarkable for containing three celebrated
statues. The man enveloped in a net, and the Pudicit&agrave; draped
from head to foot, pleased me only as specimens of the patience and
ingenuity of the sculptor. The dead Christ covered with a veil, by
Corradini, has a merit of a higher class: it is most painful to look
upon; and affected me so strongly, that I was obliged to leave the
church, and go into the air.</p>

<p>I went to-day with two agreeable and intelligent friends, to take
leave of the Studeo and the Museum. I have often resolved not to
make my little journal a mere catalogue of objects, which are to be
found in my pocket guide, and bought for a few pence; but I cannot
resist the temptation of making a few notes of admiration, and commemoration,
for my own peculiar use.</p>

<p>The Gallery of Painting contains few pictures; but among them are
some master-pieces. The St. John of Leonardo da Vinci (exquisite
as it is, considered as a mere painting), provoked me. I am sick of
his eternal simpering face: the aspect is that of a Ganymede or a
young Bacchus; and if instead of <i>Ecce Agnus Dei</i>, they had written
over it, <i>Ecce vinum bonum</i>, all would have been in character.</p>

<p>How I coveted the beautiful "Carit&agrave;," the Capo d'Opera of Schidone!&mdash;and
next to it, Parmegiano's Gouvernante&mdash;a delicious picture.
A portrait of Columbus, said to be by the same master, is not
like him, I am sure; for the physiognomy is vacant and disagreeable.
Domenichino's large picture of the Angel shielding Innocence from a
Demon pleases me, as all his pictures do&mdash;but not perfectly: the devil
in the corner, with his fork, and hoofs, and horns, shocks my taste as
a ludicrous and vulgar idea, far removed from poetry; but the figure
of the angel stretching a shield over the infant, is charming. There are
also two fine Claudes, two Holy Families, by Raffaelle, in his sweetest
style; and one by Correggio, scarcely less beautiful.</p>

<p>The Gallery of Sculpture is so rich in chef-d'&#339;uvres, that to particularise
would be a vain attempt. Passing over those which every
one knows by heart, the statue of Aristides struck me most. It was
found in Herculaneum; and is marked with ferruginous stains, as if
by the action of fire or the burning lava; but it is otherwise uninjured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and the grave, yet graceful simplicity of the figure and attitude, and the
extreme elegance of the drapery, are truly Grecian. It is the union of
<i>power</i> with <i>repose</i>&mdash;of perfect <i>grace</i> with perfect <i>simplicity</i>, which distinguishes
the ancient from the modern style of sculpture. The sitting
Agrippina, for example, furnished Canova with the model for his statue
of Madame Letitia&mdash;the two statues are, in point of fact, nearly the
same, except that Canova has turned Madame Letitia's head a little on
one side; and by this single and trifling alteration has destroyed that
quiet and beautiful simplicity which distinguishes the original, and
given his statue at once a modern air.</p>

<p>The Flora Farnese is badly placed, in a space too confined for its
size, and too near the eye; so that the exquisite harmony and delicacy
of the figure are partly lost in its colossal proportions: it should be
placed at the end of a long gallery or vista.</p>

<p>There is here a statue of Nero when he was ten years old; from
which it would seem that he was not by nature the monster he afterwards
became. The features are beautiful; and the expression all
candour and sweetness.</p>

<p>One statue struck me exceedingly&mdash;not by the choice of the subject,
nor the beauty of the workmanship, but from its wonderful force of
expression. It is a dying gladiator; but very different from the gladiator
of the Capitol. The latter declines gradually, and sickens into
death; but memory and feeling are not yet extinct: and what thoughts
may pass through that brain while life is thus languishing away!
what emotions may yet dwell upon the last beatings of that heart! it
is the <i>sentiment</i> which gives such profound pathos to that matchless
statue: but the gladiator of the Studii has only physical expression: it
is sudden death in all its horrors: the figure is still erect, though the
mortal blow has been given; the sword has dropt from the powerless
hand; the limbs are stiffening in death; the eyes are glazed; the features
fixed in an expression of mortal agony; and in another moment
you expect the figure to fall at your feet.</p>

<p>The Venus, the Hercules, the Atlas, the Antinous (not equal to that
in the Capitol,) the Ganymede, the Apollo, the equestrian statues of the
two Balbi, etc. are all familiar to my imagination, from the numerous
copies and models I have seen: but the most interesting department of
the Museum is the collection of antiques from Herculaneum and Pompeii,
which have lately been removed hither from Portici. One room
contains specimens of cooking utensils, portable kitchens, tripods, instruments
of sacrifice, small bronze Lares, and Penates, urns, lamps,
and candelabras of the most elegant forms, and the most exquisite
workmanship. Another room contains specimens of ancient armour,
children's toys, etc. I remarked here a helmet which I imagine
formed part of a trophy; or at least was intended for ornament rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
than use. It is exceedingly heavy; and on it is represented in the
most exquisite relievo the War of Troy. Benvenuto Cellini himself
never produced any thing equal to the chased work on this helmet.</p>

<p>In a third room is the paraphernalia of a lady's toilette: mirrors of
different sizes, fragments of combs, a small crystal box of rouge,
etc. Then follow flutes and pipes, all carved out of bone, surgical
instruments, moulds for pastry, sculptors' tools, locks and keys, bells, etc.</p>

<p>The room containing the antique glass, astonished me more than any
thing else. I knew that glass was an ancient invention: but I thought
that its application to domestic purposes was of modern date. Here I
found window panes, taken from the Villa of Diomed at Pompeii;
bottles of every size and form, white and coloured; pitchers and vases;
necklaces; imitations of gems, etc.</p>

<p>There is a little jeu d'esprit of Voltaire's "La Toilette de Madame
de Pompadour," in which he wittily exalts the moderns above the ancients,
and ridicules their ignorance of the luxuries and comforts of
life: but Voltaire had not seen the museum of Portici. We can add
few distinct articles to the list of comforts and luxuries it contains:
though it must be confessed that we have improved upon them, and
varied them <i>ad infinitum</i>. In those departments of the mechanics
which are in any way connected with the fine arts, the ancients appear
to have attained perfection. To them belongs the invention of
all that embellishes life, of all the graceful forms of imitative art, varied
with such exquisite taste, such boundless fertility of fancy, that nothing
is left to us but to refine upon their ideas, and copy their creations.
With all our new invented machines, and engines, we can do little
more than what the ancients performed without them.</p>

<p>I ought not to forget one room containing some objects, more curious
and amusing than beautiful, principally from Pompeii, such as loaves
of bread, reduced to a black cinder, figs in the same state, grain of
different kinds, colours from a painter's room, ear-rings and bracelets,
gems, specimens of mosaic, etc. etc.</p>

<p><i>March 7.</i>&mdash;Frattinto brought me to-day the last numbers of the
Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews: a great treat so far from home.
Both contain some clever essays: among them, an article on prisons,
in the Edinburgh, interested me most.</p>

<p>Methinks these two Reviews stalk through the literary world, like
the two giants in Pulci's Morgante Maggiore: the one pounding, slaying,
mangling, despoiling with blind fury, like the heavy orthodox
club-armed Morgante; the other, like the sneering, witty, half-pagan,
half-baptized Margutte, slashing and cutting, and piercing through
thick and thin; <i>&agrave; tort et &agrave; travers</i>. Truly the simile is more &agrave;-propos
than I thought when it first occurred to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>I went the other day to a circulating library and reading-room kept
here by a little cross French-woman, and asked to see a catalogue.
She showed me, first, a list of all the books, Italian, French, and English,
she was allowed to keep and sell: it was a thin pamphlet of about
one hundred pages. She then showed me the catalogue of prohibited
books, which was at least as thick as a good sized octavo. The book
to which I wished to refer, was the second volume of Robertson's
Charles the Fifth. After some hesitation, Madame P** led me into
a back room; and opening a sliding pannel, discovered a shelf let into
the wall, on which were arranged a number of authors, chiefly English
and French. I was not surprised to find Rousseau and Voltaire
among them; but am still at a loss to guess what Robertson has done
or written to entitle him to a place in such select company.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Forsyth might well say that Naples has no parallel on earth.
Viewed from the sea it appears like an amphitheatre of palaces, temples
and castles, raised one above another, by the wand of a necromancer:
viewed within, Naples gives me the idea of a vast Bartholomew
fair. No street in London is ever so crowded as I have seen the streets
of Naples. It is a crowd which has no pause or cessation: early in
the morning, late at night, it is ever the same. The whole population
seems poured into the streets and squares; all business and amusement
is carried on in the open air: all those minute details of domestic
life, which, in England, are confined within the sacred precincts of
<i>home</i>, are here displayed to public view. Here people buy and sell,
and work, wash, wring, brew, bake, fry, dress, eat, drink, sleep, etc.
etc. all in the open streets. We see every hour, such comical, indescribable
appalling sights; such strange figures, such wild physiognomies,
picturesque dresses, attitudes and groups&mdash;and eyes&mdash;no!
I never saw such eyes before, as I saw to-day, half languor and half
fire, in the head of a ruffian Lazzarone, and a ragged Calabrian beggar
girl. They would have <i>embr&acirc;s&eacute;</i> half London or Paris.</p>

<p>I know not whether it be incipient illness, or the enervating effects
of this soft climate, but I feel unusually weak, and the least exertion
or excitement is not only disagreeable but painful. While the rest
were at Capo di Monte, I stood upon my balcony looking out upon
the lovely scene before me, with a kind of pensive dreamy rapture,
which if not quite pleasure, had at least a power to banish pain: and
thus hours passed away insensibly&mdash;</p>

<p>All my activity of mind, all my faculties of thought and feeling and
suffering, seemed lost and swallowed up in an indolent delicious reverie,
a sort of vague and languid enjoyment, the true "<i>dolce far
niente</i>" of this enchanting climate. I stood so long leaning on my
elbow without moving, that my arm has been stiff all day in consequence.</p>

<p>"How I wish," said I this evening, when they drew aside the
curtain, that I might view the sunset from my sofa, and sky, earth
and ocean, seemed to commingle in floods of glorious light&mdash;"how I
wish I could transport those skies to England!" <i>Cruelle!</i> exclaimed
an Italian behind me, <i>&ocirc;tez-nous notre beau ciel, tout est perdu pour

<p><i>Velletri, March 13.</i>&mdash;It is now a week since I opened my little
book. Ever since the 9th I have been seriously ill: and yesterday
morning I left Naples still low and much indisposed, but glad of a
change which should substitute any external excitement, however
painful, to that unutterable dying away of the heart and paralysis of
the mind which I have suffered for some days past. When we turned
into the Strada Chiaja, and I gave a last glance at the magnificent bay
and the shores all resplendent with golden light, I could almost have
exclaimed like Eve, "must I then leave thee, Paradise!" and dropped
a few natural tears&mdash;tears of weakness, rather than of grief: for what
do I leave behind me worthy one emotion of regret? Even at Naples,
even in this all-lovely land, "fit haunt for gods," has it not been with
me as it has been elsewhere? as long as the excitement of change and
novelty lasts, my heart can turn from itself "to luxuriate with indifferent
things:" but it cannot last long; and when it is over, I
suffer, I am ill: the past returns with tenfold gloom; interposing like
a dark shade between me and every object: an evil power seems to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
reside in every thing I see, to torment me with painful associations,
to perplex my faculties, to irritate and mock me with the perception
of what is lost to me: the very sunshine sickens me, and I am
forced to confess myself weak and miserable as ever. O time! how
slowly you move! how little you can do for me! and how bitter is
that sorrow which has no relief to hope but from time alone!</p>

<p>Last night we reached Mola di Ga&euml;ta, which looked even more
beautiful than before, in the eyes of all but <i>one</i>, whose senses were
blinded and dulled by dejection, lassitude, and sickness. When I
felt myself passively led along the shore, placed where the eye might
range at freedom over the living and rejoicing landscape&mdash;when I
heard myself repeating mechanically the exclamations of others, and
felt no ray of beauty, no sense of pleasure penetrate to my heart&mdash;shall
I own, even to myself, the mixture of anguish and terror with
which I shrunk back, conscious of the waste within me? The conviction
that now it was all over, that the last and only pleasures
hitherto left to me had perished, that my mind was contracted by the
selfishness of despondency, and my quick spirit of enjoyment utterly
subdued into apathy, gave me for a moment a pang sharper than if a
keen knife had cut me to the quick; and then I relapsed into a kind
of torpid languor of mind and frame, which I thought was resignation,
and as such indulged it.</p>

<p>From my bed this morning I stepped out upon my balcony just as
the sun was rising. I wished to convince myself whether the beauty
on which I had lately looked with such admiration and delight, had
indeed lost all power to touch my heart. The impression made upon
my mind at that instant I can only compare to the rolling away of a
palpable and suffocating cloud: every thing on which I looked had
the freshness and brightness of novelty: a glory beyond its own was
again diffused over the enchanting scene from the stores of my own
imagination: the sea breeze which blew against my temples new-strung
every nerve; and I left Mola with a heart so lightened and so
grateful, that not for hours afterwards, not till fatigue and hurry had
again wearied down my spirits, did that impression of happy thankfulness
pass away.</p>

<p>I am sensible I owed this sudden renovation of health solely to the
contemplation of Nature; and a true feeling for all the "maggior
pompa" she has poured forth over this glorious region. The shores
of Terracina, the azure sea, dancing in the breeze, the waves rolling
to our feet, the sublime cliffs, the fleet of forty sail stretching away
till lost in the blaze of the horizon, the Circean promontory, even the
picturesque fisherman, whom we saw throwing his nets from an insulated
rock at some distance from the shore, and whom a very trifling
exertion of fancy might have converted into some sea divinity, a Glaucus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
or a Proteus, formed altogether a picture of the most wonderful
and luxuriant beauty. In England there is a peculiar charm in the
soft a&euml;rial perspective, which even in the broadest glare of noonday,
blends and masses the forms of the distant landscape; and in that
mingling of colours into a cool neutral gray tint so grateful to the eye.
Hence it has happened that in some of the Italian pictures I have seen
in England, I have often been struck by what appeared to me a violence
in the colouring, and a sharp decision in the outline, o'erstepping
the modesty of nature&mdash;that is, of <i>English nature</i>: but there is
in this climate a prismatic splendour of tint, a glorious all-embracing
light, a vivid distinctness of outline, something in the reality more
gorgeous, glowing, and luxuriant, than poetry could dare to express,
or painting imitate.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah that such beauty, varying in the light<br /></span>

<p>And now we have left the enchanting south; myrtle-hedges, palm-trees,
orange-groves, bright Mediterranean, all adieu! How, under
other circumstances, should I regret you, with what reluctance
should I leave you, thus half explored, half enjoyed! but now other
thoughts engross me, the hard struggle to overcome myself, or at
least to appear the thing I am not.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Man has done what he can to deform this lovely region. The most
horrible places we have yet met with are Itri and Fondi, which look
like recesses of depravity and dirt, and the houses more like the dens
and kennels of wild beasts, than the habitations of civilized human
beings. In fact, the populace of these towns consists chiefly of the
families of the briganti. The women we saw here were bold coarse
Amazons; and the few men who appeared had a slouching gait, and
looked at us from under their eyebrows with an expression at once
cunning and fierce. <a name="We" id="We"></a>We met many begging friars&mdash;horrible specimens
of their species: altogether I never beheld such a desperate
set of canaille as appear to have congregated in these two wretched
towns.</p>

<p>At Mola I remarked several beautiful women. Their head-dress is
singularly graceful: the hair being plaited round the back of the head,
and there fastened with two silver pins, much in the manner of some of
the ancient statues. The costume of the peasantry, there, and all the
way to Rome, is very striking and picturesque. I remember one
woman whom I saw standing at her door spinning with her distaff:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
her long black hair, floating down from its confinement, was spread
over her shoulders; not hanging in a dishevelled and slovenly style,
but in the most rich and luxuriant tresses. Her attitude as she stood
suspending her work to gaze at <i>me</i>, as I gazed at her with open admiration,
was graceful and dignified; and her form and features would
have been a model for a Juno or a Minerva.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p><i>Rome, March 15.</i>&mdash;We arrived here yesterday morning about
one, after a short but delightful journey from Velletri. We have now
a suite of apartments in the Hotel d'Europe; and our accommodations
are in all respects excellent, almost equal to Schneiderf's at Florence.</p>

<p>On entering Rome through the gate of the Lateran, I was struck by
the emptiness and stillness of the streets, contrasted with those of Naples;
and still more by the architectural grandeur and beauty which
everywhere met the eye. This is as it should be: the merry, noisy,
half-naked, merry-andrew set of ragamuffins which crowd the streets
and shores of Naples, would strangely misbecome the desolate majesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of the "Eternal City." Though we now reside in the most fashionable
and frequented part of Rome, the sound of carts and carriages is seldom
heard. After nine in the evening a profound stillness reigns; and I
distinguish nothing from my window but the splashing of the Fountain
della Barchetta.</p>

<p>The weather is lovely; we were obliged to close our Venetian
blinds against the heat at eight this morning, and afterwards we drove
to the gardens of the Villa Borghese, where we wandered about in
search of coolness and shade.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>26.</i>&mdash;I must now descend to the common occurrences of our every-day
life.</p>

<p>For the last week we have generally spent the whole or part of the
morning, in some of the galleries of art; and the afternoon in the
gardens of the neighbouring villas. Those of the Villa Medici have
their vicinity to our inn, and their fine air to recommend them. From
the Villa Lanti, and the Monte Mario, we have a splendid view of the
whole city and Campagna of Rome. The Pope's gardens on the
Monte Cavallo, are pleasant, <a name="accessible" id="accessible"></a>accessible, and very private: the gardens
of the Villa Pamfili, are enchanting; but our usual haunt is the garden
of the Villa Borghese. In this delightful spot we find shade and
privacy, or sunshine and society, as we may feel inclined. To-day
it was intensely hot; but we found the cool sequestered walks and alleys
of cypress and ilex, perfectly delicious. I spread my shawl upon
a green bank carpeted with violets, and lounged in most luxurious indolence.
I had a book with me, but felt no inclination to read. The
soft air, the trickling and murmuring of innumerable fountains, the
urns, the temples, the statues&mdash;the localities of the scene&mdash;all dispose
the mind to a kind of vague but delightful reverie to which we "find
no end, in wandering mazes lost."</p>

<p>In these gardens we frequently meet the Princess Pauline: sometimes
alone, but oftener surrounded by a cort&egrave;ge of beaux. She is no
longer the "Venere Vincitrice" of Canova; but her face, though faded,
is pretty and intelligent; and she still preserves the "andar celeste,"
and all the distinguished elegance of her petite and graceful figure.
Of the stories told of her, I suppose one half <i>may</i> be true&mdash;and that
half is quite enough. She is rather more famous for her gallantries,
than for her bon-gout in the choice of her favourites; but it is justice
to Pauline to add, that her native benevolence of heart seems to have
survived all her frailties; and every one who speaks of her here,
even those who must condemn her, mention her in a tone of kindness,
and even of respect. She is still in deep mourning for the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Villa Pamfili is about two miles from Rome on the other side of
the Monte Gianicolo. The gardens are laid out in the artificial style<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of Italian gardening, a style which in England would horrify me as
in the vilest and most old-fashioned taste&mdash;stiff, cold, unnatural, and
altogether detestable. Through what inconsistency or perversity of
taste is it then, that I am enchanted with the fantastic elegance, and
the picturesque gaiety of the Pamfili gardens; where sportive art revels
and runs wild amid the luxuriance of nature? Or is it, as I would
rather believe, because these long arcades of verdure, these close <i>walls</i>
of laurel, pervious to the air, but impervious to the sunshine, these
broad umbrageous avenues and marble terraces, these paved grottoes
and ever trickling fountains, these gods and nymphs, and urns and
sarcophagi, meeting us at every turn with some classical or poetical association,
harmonize with the climate and the country, and the minds
of the people; and are <i>comfortable</i> and consistent as a well carpeted
drawing-room and a warm chimney-corner would be in England?</p>

<p>"But it is all so artificial and unnatural"&mdash;Agreed;&mdash;so are our
yellow unsheltered gravel walks, meandering through smooth shaven
lawns, which have no other beauty than that of being dry when every
other place is wet; our shapeless flower-beds so elaborately irregular,
our clumps and dots of trees, and dwarfish shrubberies. I have seen
some over-dressed grounds and gardens in England, the perpetrations
of Capability Brown and his imitators, the landscape gardeners, quite as
bad as any thing I see here, only in a different style, and certainly
more adapted to England and English taste. I must confess, that in
these enchanting gardens of the Villa Pamfili, a little less "ingenuity
and artifice" would be better. I hate <i>mere</i> tricks and gimcrackery,
of which there are a few instances, such as their hydraulic music,
jets-d'eau&mdash;water-works that play occasionally to the astonishment of
children and the profit of the gardeners&mdash;but how different, after all,
are these Italia gardens to the miserable grandeur, and senseless, tasteless
parade of Versailles!</p>

<p>In these gardens an interesting discovery has just been made; an
extensive burial place, or columbarium, in singular preservation. The
skeletons and ashes have not been removed. Some of the tombs are
painted in fresco, others floored with very pretty mosaic. The disposition
of the urns is curious: they are imbedded in the masonry of the
wall with moveable lids. On a tile I found the name of Sextus
Pompeius, in letters beautifully formed, and deeply and distinctly cut,
and an inscription which I was not Latinist enough to translate accurately,
but from which it appears that these columbaria belonged to a
branch of the Pompey family.</p>

<p><i>27.</i>&mdash;To-day, after English chapel, I look a walk to the San Gregorio,
on the other side of the Palatine, which since I first came to
Rome has been to me a favourite and chosen spot. I sat down on the
steps of the church to rest, and enjoy at leisure the fine view of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
hill and ruins opposite. Arches on arches, a wilderness of desolation!
and mingled with massive fragments of the halls and towers of the
C&aelig;sars, were young shrubs just putting on their brightest green, and
the almond-trees covered with their gay blossoms, and the cloudless
and resplendent skies bending over all.</p>

<p>I tried to sketch the scene before me, but could not form a stroke.
I cannot now take a short walk without feeling its ill effects; and my
hand shook so much from nervous weakness, that after a few vain
efforts to steady it, I sorrowfully gave up the attempt. On returning
home by the Coliseum, and through the Forum and Capitol, I met
many things I should wish to remember. After all, what place is like
Rome, where it is impossible to move a step without meeting with
some incident or object to excite reflection, to enchant the eye, or interest
the imagination? Rome may yield to Naples or Florence in
mere external beauty; but every other spot on earth, Athens perhaps
alone excepted, must yield to Rome in interest.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>28.</i>&mdash;This morning we walked down to the studio of Mr. Wagenal,
to see the &AElig;gina marbles; which, as objects of curiosity, interested
me extremely. These statues are on a smaller scale than I expected,
being not much more than half the size of life, but of better workmanship,
and in a style of sculpture altogether different from any thing
I ever saw before. They formed the ornaments of the pediment of the
Temple of Jupiter in the island of &AElig;gina, and represented a group of
fighting and dying warriors, with an armed Pallas in the centre: but
the subject is not known.</p>

<p>The execution of these statues must evidently be referred to the earliest
ages of Grecian art; to a period when sculpture was confined to
the exact imitation of natural forms. Several of the figures were extremely
spirited, and very correct both in design and execution; but
there is no attempt at grace, and a total deficiency of ideal beauty: in
the Pallas, especially, the drapery and forms are but one remove from
the cold formal Etruscan style, which in its turn is but one remove
from the yet more tasteless Egyptian. I think it was at the Villa Albani,
I saw the singular Etruscan basso-relievo which I was able to
compare mentally with what I saw to-day; and the resemblance in
<i>manner</i> struck me immediately. Thorwaldson is now restoring these
marbles in the most admirable style for the King of Bavaria, to whom
they were sold by Messrs. Cockerel and Linkh (the original discoverers)
for 8000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Gibson, the celebrated English sculptor, joined us while looking at
the &AElig;gina marbles, and accompanied us to the studio of Pozzi, the
Florentine statuary. Here I saw several instances of that affected and
meretricious taste which prevails too much among the foreign sculptors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
I remember one example almost ludicrous, a female Satyr with her
hair turned up behind and dressed in the last Parisian fashion; as if
she had just come from under the hands of Monsieur Hyppolite. By
the same hand which committed this odd solecism, I saw a statue of
Moses, now modelling in clay, which, if finished in marble in a style
worthy of its conception, and if not spoiled by some affected niceties
in the execution, will be a magnificent and sublime work of art.</p>

<p>Gibson afterwards showed us round his own studio: his exquisite
group of Psyche borne away by the Zephyrs enchanted me. The necessity
which exists for supporting all the figures has rendered it impossible
to give them the same a&euml;rial lightness I have seen in paintings
of the same subject, yet they are all <i>but</i> a&euml;rial. Psyche was criticised
by two or three of our party; but I thought her faultless: she is a
lovely timid girl; and as she leans on her airy supporters, she seems
to contemplate her flight down the precipice, half-shrinking, though
secure. Mr. W** told me that in the original design, the left foot of
one of the Zephyrs rested upon the ground: and that Canova, coming
in by chance while Gibson was working on the model, lifted it up, and
this simple and masterly alteration has imparted the most exquisite
lightness to the attitude.</p>

<p>Gibson was Canova's favourite pupil: he has quite the air of a
genius: plain features, but a countenance all beaming with fire,
spirit, and intelligence. His Psyche remains still in the model, as he
has not yet found a patron munificent enough to order it in marble;
at which I greatly wonder. Could I but afford to bestow seven hundred
pounds on my own gratification, I would have given him the
order on the spot.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p><i>30.</i>&mdash;Yesterday we dined <i>al fresco</i> in the Pamfili gardens: and
though our party was rather too large, it was well assorted, and the
day went off admirably. The queen of our feast was in high good
humour, and irresistible in charms; Frattino very fascinating, T**
was caustic and witty, W** lively and clever, Sir J** mild, intelligent,
and elegant, V**, as usual, quiet, sensible, and self-complacent,
L** as absurd and assiduous as ever. Every body played their part
well, each by a tacit convention sacrificing to the <i>amour propre</i> of the
rest. Every individual really occupied with his own particular <i>r&ocirc;le</i>,
but all apparently happy, and mutually pleased. Vanity and selfishness,
indifference and ennui, were veiled under a general mask of good
humour and good breeding, and the flowery bonds of politeness and
gallantry held together those who knew no common tie of thought or
interest; and when parted (as they soon will be, north, south, east,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and west), will probably never meet again in this world; and whether
they do or not, who thinks or cares!</p>

<p>Our luxurious dinner, washed down by a competent proportion of
Malvoisie and Champagne, were spread upon the grass, which was
literally <i>flowery turf</i>, being covered with violets, iris, and anemones
of every dye. Instead of changing our plates, we washed them
in a beautiful fountain which murmured near us, having first, by a
libation, propitiated the presiding nymph for this pollution of her limpid
waters. For my own peculiar taste there were too many servants
(who on these occasions are always <i>de trop</i>), too many luxuries, too
much fuss; but considering the style and number of our party, it was
all consistently and admirably managed: the grouping of the company,
picturesque because unpremeditated, the scenery round, the
arcades, and bowers, and columns, and fountains, had an air altogether
quite poetical and romantic; and put me in mind of some of Watteau's
beautiful garden-pieces, and Stothard's f&ecirc;tes-champ&ecirc;tres.</p>

<p>To me the day was not a day of pleasure; for the small stock of
strength and spirits with which I set out was soon exhausted, and the
rest of the day was wasted in efforts to appear cheerful and support
myself to the end, lest I should spoil the general mirth: on all I looked
with complacency tinged with my habitual melancholy. What I
most admired was the delicious view, from an eminence in the wildest
part of the gardens, over the city and Campagna to the blue Apennines,
where Frascati and Albano peeped forth like nests of white
buildings glittering upon a rich back ground, tinted with blue and purple;
the hill where Cato's villa stood, and still called the Portian Hill,
and on the highest point the ruined temple of Jupiter Latialis visible
at the distance of seventeen miles, and shining in the setting sun like
burnished gold. What I most felt and enjoyed was the luxurious
temperature of the atmosphere, the purity and brilliance of the skies,
the delicious security with which I threw myself down on the turf
without fear of damp and cold, and the thankful consciousness, that
neither the light or worldly beings round me, nor the sadness which
weighed down my own heart, had quite deadened my once quick sense
of pleasure, but left me still some perception of the splendour and classical
interest of the glorious scenes around me, combined as it was with
all the enchantment of natural beauty&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 31.</i>&mdash;To-day the Holy week begins, and a kind of programma
of the usual ceremonies of each day was laid on my toilette
this morning. The bill of fare for this day runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Domenica delle Palme, nel Capella Papale nel Palazzo Apostolico,
canta messa un Cardinal Prete. Il Sommo Pontefice fa la benedizione
delle Palme, con processione per la Sala Regia."</p>

<p>I gave up going to the English service accordingly, and consented
to accompany R** and V** to the Pope's Chapel. We entered just
as the ceremony of blessing the palms was going on: a cardinal officiated
for the poor old pope, who is at present ill.</p>

<p>After the palms had been duly blessed, they were carried in procession
round the splendid anti-chamber, called the Sala Regia; meantime
the chapel doors were closed upon them, and on their return,
they (not the palms, but the priests) knocked and demanded entrance
in a fine recitative; two of the principal voices replied from within;
the choir without sung a response, and after a moment's silence the
doors were opened, and the service went on.</p>

<p>This was very trivial and tedious. Rospo said, very truly, that the
procession in Blue Beard was much better <i>got up</i>. All these processions
sound very fine in mere description, but in the reality there is
always something to disappoint or disgust; something which leaves
either a ludicrous or a painful impression on the mind. The old
priests and cardinals to-day looking like so many old beggar-women
dressed up in the cast-off finery of a Christmas pantomime, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>assistants
smirking and whispering, the singers grinning at each other
between every solemn strain of melody, and blowing their noses and
spitting about like true Italians&mdash;in short, the want of keeping in the
<i>tout ensemble</i> shocked my taste and my imagination, and, I may add,
better, more serious feelings. It is well to see these things once, that
we may not be cheated with fine words, but judge for ourselves. I
foresee, however, that I shall not be tempted to encounter any of the
more crowded ceremonies.</p>

<p>I remarked that all the Italians wore black to-day.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon at the Vatican. We found St. Peter's almost
deserted; few people, no music, the pictures all muffled, and the
altars hung with black drapery. The scaffolding was preparing for
the ceremonies of the week; and, on the whole, St. Peter's appeared,
for the first time, disagreeable and gloomy.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April 1.</i>&mdash;Non riconosco oggi la mia bella Italia! Clouds,
and cold, and rain, to which we have been so long unaccustomed,
seem unnatural; and deform that peculiar character of sunny loveliness
which belongs to this country: and, &agrave;-propos to climate, I may as well
observe now, that since the 1st of February, when we left Rome for
Naples, up to this present 1st of April, not one day has been so rainy
as to confine us to the house: and on referring to my memoranda of
the weather, I find that at Naples it rained one day for a few hours only,
and for about two hours on the morning we left it: since then, not a
drop of rain has fallen: all hot, cloudless, lovely weather. We have
been for the last three weeks in summer costume, and guard against
the heat as we should in England during the dog-days. To have an
idea of an Italian summer, Mr. W** says we must fancy the present
heat <i>quadrupled</i>.</p>

<p>The day, notwithstanding, has been unusually pleasant, the afternoon,
<a name="though126" id="though126"></a>though not brilliant, was clear and soft; and we drove in the
open carriage first to the little church of Santa Maria della Pace, to see
Raffaelle's famous fresco, the Four Sybils. It is in the finest preservation,
and combines all his peculiar graces of design and expression.
The colouring has not suffered from time and damp like that of
the frescos in the Vatican, but it is at once brilliant and delicate.
Nothing can exceed the exquisite grace of the Sibilla Persica, nor the
beautiful drapery and inspired look of the Cumana. Fortunately, I
had never seen any copy or engraving of this master piece: its beauty
was to me enhanced by surprise and all the charm of novelty: and my
gratification was complete.</p>

<p>We afterwards spent half an hour in the gardens of the Villa Lanti,
on the Monte Gianicolo. The view of Rome from these gardens is
superb: though the sky was clouded, the <a name="atmosphere" id="atmosphere"></a>atmosphere was perfectly
pure and clear: the eye took in the whole extent of ancient and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>modern
Rome; beyond it the Campagna, the Alban Hills, and the <a name="Apennines127" id="Apennines127"></a>Apennines,
which appeared of a deep purple, with pale clouds floating over
their summits. The city lay at our feet, silent, and clothed with the
daylight as with a garment&mdash;no smoke, no vapour, no sound, no motion,
no sign of life: it looked like a city whose inhabitants had been
suddenly petrified, or smitten by a destroying angel; and such was the
effect of its strange and solemn beauty, that, before I was aware, I felt
my eyes fill with tears as I looked upon it.</p>

<p>I saw Naples from the Castle of Saint Elmo&mdash;setting aside the sea and
Mount Vesuvius, those unequalled features in that radiant picture&mdash;the
view of the <i>city</i> of Naples is not so fine as the view of Rome: it is,
comparatively, deficient in sentiment, in interest, and in dignity.
Naples wears on her brow the voluptuous beauty of a syren&mdash;Rome
sits desolate on her seven-hilled throne, "<i>the Niobe of Nations</i>."</p>

<p>I wish I could have painted what I saw to-day <i>as</i> I saw it. Yet no&mdash;the
reality was perhaps too much like a picture to please in a picture:
the exquisite harmony of the colouring, the softness of the lights and
shades, the solemn death-like stillness, the distinctness of every form
and outline, and the classic interest attached to every noble object,
combined to form a scene, which hereafter, in the silence of my own
thoughts, I shall often love to recall and to dwell upon.</p>

<p>To-night I read with Incoronati, the Fourth book of Dante, and two
of Petrarch's Canzoni "I' vo pensando," and "Verdi panni," making
notes from his explanations and remarks as I went along. These two
Canzoni I had selected as being among the most <i>puzzling</i> as well as
the most beautiful. Those are strangely mistaken, who from a superficial
study of a few of his amatory sonnets, regard Petrarch as a mere
love-sick poet, who spent his time in be-rhyming an obdurate mistress;
and those are equally mistaken who consider him as the poetical
votarist of an imaginary fair one. I know but little, even of the little
that is known of his life; for I remember being as much terrified by
the ponderous quartos of the Abb&eacute; de Sade, as I was discomfited and
disappointed by the flimsy octavo of Mrs. Dobson. I am now studying
Petrarch in his own works; and it seemeth to me, in my simple wit,
that such exquisite touches of truth and nature, such depth and purity
of feeling, such felicity of expression, such vivid yet delicate pictures
of female beauty, could spring only from a real and heartfelt passion.
We know too little of Laura: but it is probable, if she had always preserved
a stern and unfeeling indifference, she would not have so entirely
commanded the affections of a feeling heart; and had she yielded
she would not so long have preserved her influence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Think you if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have written sonnets all his life?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>In truth she appears to have been the most finished coquette of her
own or any other age.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p><i>3.</i>&mdash;What a delight it would be, if, at the end of a day like this, I
had <i>somebody</i> with whom I could talk over things&mdash;with whose feelings
and impressions I could compare my own&mdash;who would direct my
judgment, and assist me in arranging my ideas, and double every pleasure
by sharing it with me! What would have become of me if I had
not thought of keeping a Diary? I should have died of a sort of mental
repletion! What a consolation and employment has it been to me
to let my overflowing heart and soul exhale themselves on paper!
When I have neither power nor spirits to join in common-place conversation,
I open my dear little Diary, and feel, while my pen thus
swiftly glides along, much less as if I were writing than as if I were
speaking&mdash;yes! speaking to one who perhaps will read this when I am
no more&mdash;but not till <i>then</i>.</p>

<p>I was well enough to <i>walk</i> up to the Rospigliosi Palace this morning
to see Guido's Aurora: it is on the ceiling of a pavilion: would it
were not! for I looked at it till my neck ached, and my brain turned
round "like a parish top." I can only say that it far surpassed my
expectations: the colouring is the most brilliant, yet the most harmonious,
in the world: and there is a depth, a strength, a richness in the
tints, not common to Guido's style. The whole is as fresh as if painted
yesterday; though Guido must have died sometime about 1640.</p>

<p>On each side of the hall or pavilion adorned by the Aurora, there is
a small room, containing a few excellent pictures. The Triumph of
David, by Domenichino, a fine rich picture; an exquisite Andromeda,
by Guido, painted with his usual delicacy and sentiment; the twelve
Apostles, by Rubens, some of them very fine; "the Five Senses," said
to be by Carlo Cignani, but if so he has surpassed himself: it is like
Domenichino. The Death of Samson, by L. Carracci, wearies the eye
by the number and confusion of the figures: it has no principal group
upon which the attention can rest. There is also a fine portrait of
Nicolo Poussin, by himself, and an interesting head of Guido.</p>

<p>At three o'clock we went down to the Capella Sistina to hear the
Miserere. In describing the effect produced by this divine music, the
time, the place, the scenic contrivance should be taken into account:
the time&mdash;solemn twilight, just as the shades begin to fall around: the
place&mdash;a noble and lofty hall where the terrors of Michel Angelo's Last
Judgment are rendered more terrible by the gathering gloom, and his
sublime Prophets frown dimly upon us from the walls above. The
extinguishing of the tapers, the concealed choir, the angelic voices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
chosen from among the finest in the world, and blended by long practice
into the most perfect unison, were combined to produce that overpowering
effect which has so often been described. Many ladies wept,
and one fainted. Unassisted vocal music is certainly the finest of all: no
power of instruments could have thrilled me like the blended stream
of melancholy harmony, breathed forth with such an expression of
despairing anguish, that it was almost too much to bear.</p>

<p><i>Good-Friday.</i>&mdash;I saw more new, amusing, and delightful things
yesterday, than I can attempt to describe or even enumerate: but I
think there is no danger of my forgetting general impressions: if my
memory should fail me in particulars, my imagination can always recall
the whole.</p>

<p>In the morning I declined going to see the ceremonies at the Vatican.
The procession of the host from the Sistine to the Pauline Chapel; the
washing of the Pilgrims' feet, etc.&mdash;all these things are less than indifferent
to me; and the illness and absence of the poor old pope rendered
them particularly uninteresting. Every body went but myself;
and it was agreed that we should all meet at the door of the Sistine
Chapel at five o'clock. I remained quietly at home on my sofa till one;
and then drove to the Museum of the Vatican, where I spent the rest
of the day; it was a grand festa, and the whole of the Vatican, including
the immense suite of splendid libraries, was thrown open to the
public. All the foreigners in Rome having crowded to St. Peter's, or the
chapels, to view the ceremonies going on, I was the only stranger amidst
an assemblage of the common people and peasantry, who had come to
lounge there till the lighting up of the Cross. I walked on and on, hour after
hour, lost in amazement, and wondering where and when this glorious
labyrinth was to end; successive galleries fitted up with the gay splendour
of an Oriental Haram, in which the books and manuscripts are all arranged
and numbered in cases; the beautiful perspective of hall beyond
hall vanishing away into immeasurable distance; the refulgent light
shed overall; and add to this, the extraordinary visages and costumes
of the people, who with their families wandered along in groups or
singly, all behaving with the utmost decorum, and making emphatic
exclamations on the beauties around them. "<i>Ah! che bella cosa! Cosa
rara! O bella assai!</i>" all furnished me with such ample matter for
amusement, and observation, and admiration, that I was insensible to
fatigue, and knew not that in five hours I had scarcely completed the
circuit of the Museum.</p>

<p>One room (the Camera del Papiri) struck me particularly: it is a
small octagon, the ceiling and ornaments painted by Raffaelle Mengs
with exquisite taste. The group on the ceiling represents the Muse of
History writing, while her book reposes on the wings of Time, and a
Genius supplies her with materials: the pannels of this room are formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of old manuscripts, pasted up against the walls and glazed. The effect
of the whole is as singular as beautiful.</p>

<p>A new gallery of marbles has lately been opened by the Pope,
called from its form the <i>Sala della Croce</i>: in splendid, classical, and
tasteful decoration, it equals any of the others, but is not, perhaps, so
remarkable for the intrinsic value of its contents.</p>

<p>I never more deeply felt my own ignorance and deficiencies than I
did to-day. I saw so many things I did not understand, so much
which I wished to have explained to me, I longed so inexpressibly for
someone to talk to, to exclaim to, to help me to wonder, to admire,
to be <i>extasi&eacute;e</i>! but I was alone: and I know not how it is, or why,
but when I am alone, not only my powers of enjoyment seem to fail
me in a degree, but even my mental faculties; and the multitude of my
own ideas and sensations confuse, oppress, and irritate me.</p>

<p>I walked through the whole gyro of the Museum, examining the
busts and pictures particularly, with the help of Este's admirable catalogue
raisonn&eacute;e, and at half-past five I reached the Sistine just in time
to hear the second Miserere: neither the music nor the effort were
equal to the first evening. The music, though inferior to Allegri's, was
truly beautiful and sublime; but the scenic pageantry did not strike so
much on repetition: the chapel was insufferably crowded, I was sick
and stupid from heat and fatigue, and to crown all, just in the midst of
one of the most overpowering strains, the cry of condemned souls
pleading for mercy, which made my heart pause, and my flesh creep&mdash;a
lady behind me whispered loudly, "Do look what lovely broderie
Mrs. L** has on her white satin spencer!"</p>

<p>After the Miserere, we adjourned to St. Peter's, to see the illumination
of the Girandola. I confess the first glance disappointed me; for
the cross, though more than thirty feet in height, looks trivial and diminutive,
compared with the immensity of the dome in which it is suspended;
but just as I was beginning to admire the sublime effect of the
whole scene, I was obliged to leave the church, being unable to stand
the fatigue any longer.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>To-day we have remained quietly at home, recruiting after the exertions
of yesterday. After dinner, Colonel &mdash;&mdash; and Mr. W** began
to discuss the politics of Italy, and from abusing the governments
they fell upon the people; and being of very opposite principles and
parties, they soon began an argument which ended in a warm dispute,
and sent me to take refuge in my own room. How I detest politics
and discord! How I hate the discussion of politics in Italy! and,
above all, the discussion of Italian politics, which offer no point upon
which the mind can dwell with pleasure. I have not wandered to
Italy&mdash;"this land of sun-lit skies and fountains clear," as Barry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Cornwall calls it, only to scrape together materials for a quarto tour,
or to sweep up the leavings of the "fearless" Lady Morgan; or to dwell
upon the heart-sickening realities which meet me at every turn; evils
of which I neither understand the cause nor the cure. And yet say
not to Italy</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Caduta &egrave; la tua gloria&mdash;e tu nol' vedi!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She does see it,&mdash;she does feel it. A spirit is silently and gradually
working its way beneath the surface of society, which must, erelong,
break forth either for good or for evil. Between a profligate and servile
nobility, and a degraded and enslaved populace, a middle class has
lately sprung up; the men of letters, the artists, the professors in the
sciences, who have obtained property, or distinction at least, in the
commotions which have agitated their country, and those who have
served at home or abroad in the revolutionary wars. These all seem
impelled by one and the same spirit; and make up for their want of
numbers by their activity, talents, enthusiasm, and the secret but increasing
influence which they exert over the other classes of society.
But on subjects like these, however interesting, I have no means of
obtaining information at once general and accurate: and I would rather
not think, nor speak, nor write, upon "matters which are too high for
me." Let the modern Italians be what they may,&mdash;what I hear them
styled six times a day at least&mdash;a dirty, demoralized, degraded, unprincipled
race,&mdash;centuries behind our thrice-blessed, prosperous, and
comfort-loving nation in civilization and morals; if I were come
among them as a resident, this picture might alarm me; situated as I
am, a nameless sort of person, a mere bird of passage, it concerns me
not. I am not come to spy out the nakedness of the land, but to implore
from her healing airs and lucid skies the health and peace I have
lost, and to worship as a pilgrim at the tomb of her departed glories.&mdash;I
have not many opportunities of studying the national character; I
have no dealings with the lower classes, little intercourse with the
higher. No tradesmen cheat me, no hired menials irritate me, no
innkeepers fleece me, no postmasters abuse me. I love these rich
delicious skies; I love this genial sunshine, which, even in December,
sends the spirits dancing through the veins; this pure elastic atmosphere,
which not only brings the distant landscape, but almost heaven
itself nearer to the eye; and all the treasures of art and nature which
are poured forth around me; and over which my own mind, teeming
with images, recollections, and associations, can fling a beauty even
beyond their own. I willingly turn from all that excites the spleen
and disgust of others; from all that may so easily be despised, derided&mdash;reviled,
and abandon my heart to that state of calm benevolence
towards all around me, which leaves me undisturbed, to enjoy, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>admire,
observe, reflect, remember, with pleasure, if not with profit, and
enables me to look upon the glorious scenes with which I am surrounded,
not with the impertinent inquisition of a book-maker, nor
the gloomy calculations of a politician, nor the sneering selfism of a
Smelfungus&mdash;but with the eye of the painter, and the feeling of the
poet.</p>

<p>A-propos to poets!&mdash;Lady C** has just sent us tickets for Sestini's
Accademia to-morrow night. So far from the race of Improvvisatori
being extinct, or living only in the pages of Corinne, or in the memory
of the Fantastici, and the Bandinelli, the Gianas, and the Corillas of
other days,&mdash;there is scarcely a small town in Italy, as I am informed,
without its Improvvisatore; and I know several individuals in the
higher classes of society, both here, and at Florence more particularly,
who are remarkable for possessing this extraordinary talent&mdash;though,
of course, it is only exercised for the gratification of a private circle.
Of those who make a public exhibition of their powers, Sgricci and
Sestini are the most celebrated&mdash;and of these Sgricci ranks first. I
never heard him; but Signior Incoronati, who knows him well,
described to me his talents and powers as almost supernatural. A
wonderful display of his art was the <i>improvvisazione</i>&mdash;we have no
English word for a talent which in England is unknown,&mdash;of a regular
tragedy on the Greek model, with the choruses and dialogue complete.
The subject proposed was from the story of Ulysses, which
afforded him an opportunity of bringing in the whole sonorous nomenclature
of the Heathen Mythology,&mdash;which, says Forsyth, enters in the
web of every improvvisatore, and assists the poet both with rhymes and
ideas. Most of the celebrated improvvisatori have been Florentines:
Sgricci is, I believe, a Neapolitan, and his rival Sestini a Roman.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>April 7.</i>&mdash;Any public exhibition of talent in the Fine Arts is here
called an <i>Accademia</i>. Sestini gave his Accademia in an anti-chamber
of the Palazzo &mdash;&mdash;, I forget its name, but it was much like all
the other <i>palaces</i> we are accustomed to see here; exhibiting the same
strange contrast of ancient taste and magnificence, with present
meanness and poverty. We were ushered into a lofty room of noble
size and beautiful proportions, with its rich fresco-painted walls and
ceiling faded and falling to decay; a common brick floor, and sundry
window panes broken, and stuffed with paper. The room was nearly
filled by the audience, amongst whom I remarked a great number of
English. A table with writing implements, and an old shattered
jingling piano, occupied one side of the apartment, and a small space
was left in front for the poet. Whilst we waited with some impatience
for his appearance, several persons present walked up to the table and
wrote down various subjects; which on Sestini's coming forward, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
read aloud, marking those which were distinguished by the most general
applause. This selection formed our evening's entertainment.
A lady sat down in her bonnet and shawl to accompany him; and when
fatigued, another fair musician readily supplied her place. It is seldom
that an improvvisatore attempts to recite without the assistance
of music. When Dr. Moore heard Corilla at Florence, she sung to
the accompaniment of two violins.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> La Fantastici preferred the guitar;
and I should have preferred either to our jingling harpsichord. However,
a few chords struck at intervals were sufficient to support the
voice, and mark the time. Several airs were tried, and considered
before the poet could fix on one suited to his subject and the measure
he intended to employ. In general they were pretty and simple, consisting
of very few notes, and more like a chant or recitative, than a
regular air: one of the most beautiful I have obtained, and shall bring
with me to England.</p>

<p>The moment Sestini had made his choice, he stepped forward, and
without further pause or preparation, began with the first subject upon
his list,&mdash;"<i>Il primo Navigatore</i>."</p>

<p>Gesner's beautiful Idyl of "<i>The First Navigator</i>," supplied Sestini
with the Story, in all its details; but he versified it with surprizing facility:
and, as far as I could judge, with great spirit and elegance.
He added, too, some trifling circumstances, and several little <i>traits</i>,
the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of which afforded considerable amusement. When an
accurate rhyme, or apt expression, did not offer itself on the instant it
was required, he knit his brows and clenched his fingers with impatience;
but I think he never hesitated more than half a second. At
the moment the chord was struck, the rhyme was ready. In this
manner he poured forth between thirty and forty stanzas, with still
increasing animation; and wound up his poem with some beautiful
images of love, happiness, and innocence. Of his success I could form
some idea by the applauses he received from better judges than
myself.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' repose and a glass of water, he next called on
the company to supply him with rhymes for a sonnet. These, as fast
as they were suggested by various persons, he wrote down on a slip of
paper. The last rhyme given was "<i>Ostello</i>,"&mdash;(a common alehouse)&mdash;at
which he demurred, and submitting to the company the
difficulty of introducing so vulgar a word into an heroic sonnet, respectfully
begged that another might be substituted. A lady called out
"<i>Avello</i>" the poetical term for a grave, or a sepulchre, which expression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
bore a happy analogy to the subject proposed. The poet smiled,
well pleased;&mdash;and stepping forward with the paper in his hand, he
immediately, without even a moment's preparation, recited a sonnet on
the second subject upon his list,&mdash;"<i>La Morte di Alfieri</i>."&mdash;I could
better judge of the merit of this effusion, because he spoke it unaccompanied
by music; and his enunciation was remarkably distinct. The
subject was popular, and treated with much feeling and poetic fervour.
After lamenting Alfieri as the patriot, as well as the bard, and as the
glory of his country, he concluded, by indignantly repelling the supposition
that "the latest sparks of genius and freedom were buried in
the tomb of Vittorio Alfieri." A thunder of applause followed; and
cries of "O bravo Sestini! bravo Sestini!" were echoed from the Italian
portion of the audience, long after the first acclamations had subsided.
The men rose simultaneously from their seats; and I confess I could
hardly keep mine. The animation of the poet, and the enthusiasm of
the audience, sent a thrill through every nerve and filled my eyes with
tears.</p>

<p>The next subject was "<i>La Morte di Beatrice Cenci</i>;"&mdash;and this,
I think, was a failure. The frightful story of <i>Cenci</i> is too well known
in England since the publication of Shelley's Tragedy. Here it is familiar
to all classes; and though two centuries have since elapsed, it
seems as fresh in the memory, or rather in the imagination of these
people, as if it had happened but yesterday. The subject was not well
chosen for a public and mixed assembly; and Sestini, without adverting
to the previous details of horror, confined himself most scrupulously,
with propriety, to the subject proposed. He described Beatrice led to
execution,&mdash;"<i>con baldanza casta e generosa</i>"&mdash;and the effect produced
on the multitude by her youth:&mdash;not forgetting to celebrate
"<i>those tresses like threads of gold whose wavy splendour dazzled all
beholders</i>," as they are described by a contemporary writer. He put into
her mouth a long and pious dying speech, in which she expressed her
trust in the blessed Virgin, and her hopes of pardon from eternal justice
and mercy. To my surprise, he also made her in one stanza confess
and repent the murder, or rather sacrifice,<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> which she had perpetrated;
which is contrary to the known fact, that Beatrice <i>never</i> confessed to
the last moment of existence, nor gave any reason to suppose that she
repented. The whole was drawn out to too great a length, and, with
the exception of a few happy touches, and pathetic sentiments, went off
flatly. It was very little applauded.</p>

<p>The next subject was the "<i>Immortality of the Soul</i>," on which the
poet displayed amazing pomp and power of words, and a wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
affluence of ideas. He showed, too, an intimate acquaintance with all
that had ever been said, or sung, upon the same subject, from Plato to
Thomas Aquinas. I confess I derived little benefit from all this display
of poetry and erudition; for, after the first few stanzas, finding himself
irretrievably perplexed by the united difficulties of the language and
the subject, I withdrew my attention, and amused myself with the
paintings on the walls, and with reveries on the past and present, till I
was roused by the acclamations that followed the conclusion of the poem;
which excited very general admiration and applause.</p>

<p>The company then furnished the <i>bouts-rim&eacute;s</i> for another sonnet:
the subject was "<i>L'Amor della Patria</i>." The title, even before he
began, was hailed by a round of plaudits; and the sonnet itself was
excellent and spirited. <i>Excellent</i> I mean in its general effect, as an
<i>improvvisazione</i>:&mdash;how it would stand the test of cool criticism I cannot
tell; nor is that any thing to the purpose: these extemporaneous
effusions ought to be judged merely as what they are,&mdash;not as finished
or correct poems, but as wonderful exercises of tenacious memory,
ready wit, and that quickness of imagination which can soar</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"al bel cimento<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sulle ali dell' momento."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To return to Sestini. It may be imagined, that on such a subject as
"<i>L'Amor della Patria</i>," the ancient Roman worthies were not forgotten,
and accordingly, a Brutus, a Scipio, a Fabius, or a Fabricius,
figured in every line. And surely on no occasion could they have
been more appropriately introduced:&mdash;in Rome, and when addressing
Romans, who showed, by their enthusiastic applause, that though the
spirit of their forefathers may be extinct, their memory is not.</p>

<p>The next subject, which formed a sort of <i>pendant</i> to the Cenci, was
the "<i>Parricide of Tullia</i>." In this again his success was complete.
The stanza in which Tullia ordered her charioteer to "drive on," was
given with such effect as to electrify us: and a sudden burst of approbation
which caused a momentary interruption, evidently lent the
poet fresh spirits and animation.</p>

<p>The evening concluded with a lively burlesque, entitled "<i>Il Mercato
d'Amore</i>" which represented Love as setting up a shop to sell
"<i>la Mercanzia della Giovent&ugrave;</i>." The list of his stock in trade, though
it could not boast of much originality, was given with admirable wit
and vivacity. In conclusion, Love being threatened with a bankruptcy,
took shelter, as the poet assured us, in the bright eyes of the ladies
present. This farewell compliment was prettily turned, and intended,
of course, to be general: but it happened, luckily for Sestini, that just
opposite to him, and fixed upon him at the moment, were two of the
brightest eyes in the world. Whether he owed any of his inspiration to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
their beams I know not; but the <i>&agrave;-propos</i> of the compliment was
seized immediately, and loudly applauded by the gentlemen round
us.</p>

<p>Sestini is a young man, apparently about five-and-twenty: of a
slight and delicate figure, and in his whole appearance, odd, wild, and
picturesque. He has the common foreign trick of running his fingers
through his black bushy hair; and accordingly it stands on end in all
directions. A pair of immense whiskers, equally black and luxuriant,
meet at the point of his chin, encircling a visage of most cadaverous
hue, and features which might be termed positively ugly, were it not
for the "<i>vago spirito ardento</i>" which shines out from his dark eyes,
and the fire and intelligence which light up his whole countenance, till
it almost kindles into beauty. Though he afterwards conversed with
apparent ease, and replied to the compliments of the company, he was
evidently much exhausted by his exertions. I should fear that their
frequent repetition, and the effervescence of mind, and nervous excitement
they cannot but occasion, must gradually wear out his delicate
frame and feeble temperament, and that the career of this extraordinary
genius will be short as it is brilliant.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p><i>April 8.</i>&mdash;As Maupertuis said after his journey to Lapland&mdash;for the
universe I would not have missed the sights and scenes of yesterday;
but, for the whole universe, I would not undergo such another day of
fatigue, anxiety, and feverish excitement.</p>

<p>In the morning about ten o'clock, we all went down to St. Peter's,
to hear high mass. The absence of the Pope (who is still extremely
ill) detracted from the interest and dignity of the ceremony: there was
no general benediction from the balcony of St. Peter's; and nothing
pleased me, except the general <i>coup d'&#339;il</i>; which in truth was splendid.
The theatrical dresses of the mitred priests, the countless multitude
congregated from every part of Christendom, in every variety of
national costume, the immensity and magnificence of the church, and
the glorious sunshine&mdash;all these enchanted the eye; but I could have
fancied myself in a theatre. I saw no devotion, and I felt none. The
whole appeared more like a triumphal pageant acted in honour of a
heathen deity, than an act of worship and thanksgiving to the Great
Father of all.</p>

<p>I observed an immense number of pilgrims, male and female, who
had come from various parts of Italy to visit the shrine of St. Peter on
this grand occasion. I longed to talk to a man who stood near me,
with a very singular and expressive countenance, whose cape and
looped hat were entirely covered with scallop shells and reliques, and
his long staff surmounted by a death's head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>I was restrained by a feeling which I now think rather ridiculous:
I feared, lest by conversing with him, I should diminish the effect his
romantic and picturesque figure had made on my imagination.</p>

<p>The exposition of the relics was from a balcony half way up the
dome, so high and distant that I could distinguish nothing but the impression
of our Saviour's face on the handkerchief of St. Veronica,
richly framed&mdash;at the sight whereof the whole multitude prostrated
themselves to the earth: the other relics I forget, but they were all
equally marvellous and equally credible.</p>

<p>We returned after a long fatiguing morning to an early dinner;
and then drove again to the Piazza of St. Peter's, to see the
far-famed illumination of the church. We had to wait a considerable
time; but the scene was so novel and beautiful, that I found
ample amusement in my own thoughts and observations. The twilight
rapidly closed round us: the long lines of statues along the roof and
balustrades, faintly defined against the evening sky, looked like spirits
come down to gaze; a prodigious crowd of carriages, and people on
foot, filled every avenue: but all was still, except when a half-suppressed
murmur of impatience broke through the hushed silence of
suspense and expectation. At length, on a signal, which was given
by the firing of a cannon, the whole of the immense fa&ccedil;ade and dome,
even up to the cross on the summit, and the semicircular colonnades
in front, burst into a blaze, as if at the touch of an enchanter's wand;
adding the pleasure of surprise to that of delight and wonder. The
carriages now began to drive rapidly round the piazza, each with a
train of running footmen, flinging their torches round and dashing
them against the ground. The shouts and acclamations of the crowd,
the stupendous building with all its architectural outlines and projections,
defined in lines of living flame, the universal light, the sparkling
of the magnificent fountains&mdash;produced an effect far beyond any thing
I could have anticipated, and more like the gorgeous fictions of the
Arabian Nights, than any earthy reality.</p>

<p>After driving round the piazza, we adjourned to a balcony which had
been hired for us overlooking the Tiber, and exactly opposite to the
Castle of St. Angelo. Hence we commanded a view of the fireworks,
which were truly superb, but made me so nervous and giddy with
noise and light and wonder, that I was rejoiced when all was over.
A flight of a thousand sky-rockets sent up at once, blotting the stars
and the moonlight&mdash;dazzling our eyes, stunning our ears, and amazing
all our senses together, concluded the Holy Week at Rome.</p>

<p>To-morrow morning we start for Florence, and to-night I close this
second volume of my Diary. Thanks to my little ingenious Frenchmen
in the Via Santa Croce, I have procured a lock for a third volume,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
almost equal to my patent <i>Bramah</i> in point of security, though very
unlike it in every other respect.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Viterbo</i>, <i>April 9.</i>&mdash;"In every bosom Italy is the <i>second</i> country
in the world, the surest proof that it is in reality the <i>first</i>."</p>

<p>This elegant and just observation occurs, I think, in Arthur Young's
travels; I am not sure I quote the words correctly, but the sense will
come home to every cultivated mind with the force of a proverbial
truism.</p>

<p>One leaves Naples as a man parts with an enchanting mistress,
and Rome as we would bid adieu to an old and dear-loved friend. I
love it, and grieve to leave it for its own sake; it is painful to quit a
place where we leave behind us many whom we love and regret; and
almost or quite as painful, I think, to quit a place in which we leave
behind us no one to regret, or think of us more; a feeling like this
mingled with the sorrow with which I bade adieu to Rome this
morning.</p>

<p>Our journey has been fatiguing, <i>triste</i>, and tedious.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Radicofani</i>, <i>10th.</i>&mdash;I could almost regret at this moment that I am
past the age of romance, for I am in a fine situation for mysterious
and imaginary horrors, could I but feel again as I did at gay sixteen;
but, alas! <i>ces beaux jours sont pass&eacute;s</i>! and here I am on the top of a
dreary black mountain, in a rambling old inn which looks like a ci-devant
hospital or dismantled barracks, in a bed-room which resembles
one of the wards of a poor-house, one little corner lighted by my lamp,
and the other three parts all lost in black ominous darkness; while a
tempest rages without as if it would break in the rattling casements,
and burst the roof over our heads; and yet, insensible that I am! I
can calmly take up my pen to amuse myself by scribbling, since
sleep is impossible. I can look round my vast and solitary room
without fancying a ghost or an assassin in every corner, and listen to
the raving and lamenting of the storm, without imagining I hear in
every gust the shrieks of wailing spirits, or the groans of murdered
travellers; only wishing that the wind were rather less cold, or my
fire a little brighter, or my dormitory less <i>infinitely</i> spacious; for at
present its boundaries are invisible.</p>

<p>The first part of our journey this morning was delightful and picturesque;
we passed the beautiful lake of Bolsena and Montepulciano,
so famous for its wine (<i>il Rei di Vino</i>, as Redi calls it in the <i>Bacco
in Toscana</i>). Later in the day we entered a gloomy and desolate
country; and after crossing the rapid and muddy torrent of Rigo, which,
as our <i>Guide des Voyageurs</i> wittily informs us, we shall have to cross<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<i>four</i> times if we are not drowned the <i>third</i> time, we began to ascend
the mountainous region which divides the Tuscan from the Roman
states&mdash;a succession of wild barren hills, intersected in every direction
by deep ravines, and presenting a scene, sublime indeed from its waste
and wild grandeur, but destitute of all beauty, interest, magnificence
and variety.</p>

<p>I remember the strange emotion which came across me, when&mdash;on
the horses stopping to breathe on the summit of a lofty ridge, where
all around, as far as the eye could reach, nothing was to be seen but
the same unvarying, miserable, heart-sinking barrenness, without a
trace of human habitation, except the black fort or the highest point of
Radicofani&mdash;a soft sound of bells came over my ear as if brought
upon the wind. There is something in the sound of bells in the
midst of a solitude which is singularly striking, and may be cheering
or melancholy, according to the mood in which we may happen
to be.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Florence, April 14.</i>&mdash;I have not written a word since we arrived
at Sienna. What would it avail me to keep a mere journal of suffering?
O that I could change as others do, could forget that such things
have been which can never be again! that there were not this tenacity
in my heart and soul which clings to the shadow though the substance
be gone!</p>

<p>This is not a mere effusion of low spirits; I was never more cheerful.
I have just left a gay party, where Mr. Rogers (whom by special good
fortune we meet at every resting-place, and who dined with us to-day)
has been entertaining us delightfully. I disdain low spirits as a mere
disease which comes over us, generally from some physical or external
cause; to prescribe for them is as easy as to disguise them is difficult:
but the hopeless, cureless sadness of a heart which droops with regret,
and throbs with resentment, is easily, very easily disguised, but not
so easily banished. I hear every body round me congratulating themselves,
and <i>me</i> more particularly, that we have at last reached Florence,
that we are so far advanced on our road homewards, that soon
we shall be at Paris, and Paris is to do wonders&mdash;Paris and Dr.
R** are to <i>set me up</i> again, as the phrase is. But I shall never be
set up again, I shall never live to reach Paris; none can tell how I
sicken at the very name of that detested place; none seem aware how
fast, how very fast the principle of life is burning away within me:
but why should I speak? and what earthly help can now avail me? I
can suffer in silence, I can conceal the weakness which increases upon
me, by retiring, as if from choice and not necessity, from all exertion
not absolutely inevitable; and the change is so gradual, none will <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>perceive
it till the great change of all comes, and then I shall be at
rest.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Florence looked most beautiful as we approached it from the south,
girt with her theatre of verdant hills, and glittering in the sunshine.
All the country from Sienna to Florence is richly cultivated; diversified
with neat hamlets, farms and villas. I was more struck with the appearance
of the Tuscan peasantry on my return from the Papal dominions
than when we passed through the country before: no where
in Tuscany have we seen that look of abject negligent poverty, those
crowds of squalid beggars which shocked us in the Ecclesiastical States.
In the towns where we stopped to change horses, we were presently
surrounded by a crowd of people: the women came out spinning, or
sewing and plaiting the Leghorn hats; the children threw flowers into
our barouche, the men grinned and gaped, but there was no vociferous
begging, no disgusting display of physical evils, filth, and wretchedness.
The motive was merely that idle curiosity for which the Florentines
in all ages have been remarked. I remember an amusing
instance which occurred when I was here in December last. I was
standing one evening in the Piazza del Gran Duca, looking at the group
of the Rape of the Sabines: in a few minutes a dozen people gathered
round me, gaping at the statue, and staring at that and at me alternately,
either to enjoy my admiration, or find out the cause of it: the
people came out of the neighbouring shops, and the crowd continued
to increase, till at length, though infinitely amused, I was glad to make
my escape.</p>

<p>I suffered from cold when first we arrived at Florence, owing to the
change of climate, or rather to mere weakness and fatigue: to-day I
begin to doubt the possibility of outliving an Italian summer. The
blazing atmosphere which depresses the eyelids, the enervating heat,
and the rich perfume of the flowers all around us, are almost too
much.</p>

<p><i>April 20.</i>&mdash;During our stay at Florence, it has been one of my favourite
occupations to go to the Gallery or the Pitti Palace, and placing
my portable seat opposite to some favourite pictures, minutely study
and compare the styles of the different masters. By the style of any
particular painter, I presume we mean to express the combination of
two separate essentials&mdash;first, his peculiar conception of his subject;
secondly, his peculiar method of executing that conception, with regard
to colouring, drawing, and what artists call handling. The
former department of style lies in the mind, and will vary according
to the feelings, the temper, the personal habits, and previous education
of the painter: the latter is merely mechanical, and is technically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
termed the <i>manner</i> of a painter; it may be cold or warm, hard, dry,
free, strong, tender: as we say the cold manner of Sasso Ferrato, the
warm manner of Giorgione, the hard manner of Holbein, the dry
manner of Perugino, the free manner of Rubens, the strong manner
of Carravaggio, and so forth; I heard an amateur once observe, that
one of Morland's Pig-sties was painted with great <i>feeling</i>: all this refers
merely to mechanical execution.</p>

<p>I am no connaisseur; and I should have lamented, as a misfortune,
the want of some fixed principles of taste and criticism to guide my
judgment; some nomenclature by which to express certain effects, peculiarities,
and excellencies which I felt, rather than understood; if
my own ignorance had not afforded considerable amusement to myself,
and perhaps to others. I have derived some gratification from observing
the gradual improvement of my own taste: and from comparing
the decisions of my own unassisted judgment and natural feelings,
with the fiat of profound critics and connaisseurs: the result has been
sometimes mortifying, sometimes pleasing. Had I visited Italy in the
character of a ready-made connaisseur, I should have lost many
pleasures; for as the eye becomes more practised, the taste becomes
more discriminative and fastidious; and the more extensive our
acquaintance with the works of art, the more limited is our sphere of
admiration; as if the circle of enjoyment contracted round us, in proportion
as our sense of beauty became more intense and exquisite. A
thousand things which once had power to charm, can charm no longer;
but, <i>en revanche</i>, those which <i>do</i> please, please a thousand times
more: thus what we lose on one side, we gain on the other. Perhaps,
on the whole, a technical knowledge of the arts is apt to divert
the mind from the general effect, to fix it on petty details of execution.
Here comes a connaisseur, who has found his way, good man! from
Somerset House, to the Tribune at Florence: see him with one hand
passed across his brow, to shade the light, while the other extended
forwards, describes certain indescribable circumvolutions in the air,
and now he retires, now advances, now recedes again, till he has hit
the exact distance from which every point of beauty is displayed to the
best possible advantage, and there he stands&mdash;gazing, as never gazed
the moon upon the waters, or love-sick maiden upon the moon! We
take him perhaps for another Pygmalion? We imagine that it is
those parted and half-breathing lips, those eyes that <i>seem</i> to float in
light; the pictured majesty of suffering virtue, or the tears of repenting
loveliness; the divinity of beauty, or "<i>the beauty of holiness</i>," which
have thus transfixed him? No such thing: it is <i>fleshiness</i> of the
tints, the <i>vaghezza</i> of the colouring, the brilliance of the carnations,
the fold of a robe, or the fore-shortening of a little finger. O!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
whip me such connaisseurs! the critic's stop-watch was nothing to
this.</p>

<p>Mere mechanical excellence, and all the tricks of art have their
praise as long as they are subordinate and conduce to the general effect.
In painting as in her sister arts it is necessary</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Che l'arte che tutto fa nulla si scuopre."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of course I do not speak here of the Dutch school, whose highest
aim, and highest praise, is exquisite mechanical precision in the representation
of common nature and still life: but of those pictures
which are the productions of mind, which address themselves to the understanding,
the fancy, the feelings, and convey either a moral or a
poetical pleasure.</p>

<p>In taking a retrospective view of all the best collections in Italy
and of the Italian school in particular, I have been struck by the
endless multiplication of the same subjects, crucifixions, martyrdoms,
and other scripture horrors;&mdash;virgins, saints, and holy families. The
prevalence of the former class of subjects is easily explained, and has
been ingeniously defended; but it is not so easily reconciled to the imagination.
The mind and the eye are shocked and fatigued by the
succession of revolting and sanguinary images which pollute the walls
of every palace, church, gallery, and academy, from Milan to Naples.
The splendour of the execution only adds to their hideousness; we at
once seek for nature, and tremble to find it. It is hateful to see the
loveliest of the arts degraded to such butcher-work. I have often
gone to visit a famed collection with a secret dread of being led through
a sort of intellectual shambles, and returned with the feeling of one
who had supped full of horrors. I do not know how <i>men</i> think, and feel,
though I believe many a man, who with every other feeling absorbed
in overpowering interest, could look unshrinking upon a real scene of
cruelty and blood, would shrink away disgusted and sickened from the
cold, obtrusive, <i>painted</i> representation of the same object; for the
truth of this I appeal to men. I can only see with woman's eyes, and
think and feel as I believe every woman <i>must</i>, whatever may be her
love for the arts. I remember that in one of the palaces at Milan&mdash;(I
think it was in the collection of the Duca Litti)&mdash;we were led up to a
picture defended from the air by a plate of glass, and which being
considered as the gem of the collection, was reserved for the last as a
kind of <i>bonne bouche</i>. I gave but one glance, and turned away
loathing, shuddering, sickening. The cicerone looked amazed at my
bad taste, he assured me it was <i>un vero Correggio</i> (which by the way
I can never believe), and that the duke had refused for it I know not
how many thousand scudi. It would be difficult to say what was
most execrable in this picture, the appalling nature of the subject, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
depravity of mind evinced in its conception, or the horrible truth and
skill with which it was delineated. I ought to add that it hung up in
the family dining-room and in full view of the dinner-table.</p>

<p>There is as picture among the chefs-d'&#339;uvres in the Vatican, which,
if I were pope (or Pope Joan) for a single day, should be burnt by the
common hangman, "with the smoke of its ashes to poison the air,"
as it now poisons the sight by its unutterable horrors. There is another
in the Palazzo Pitti, at which I shiver still, and unfortunately
there is no avoiding it, as they have hung it close to Guido's lovely
Cleopatra. In the gallery there is a Judith and Holofernes which
irresistibly strikes the attention&mdash;if any thing would add to the horror
inspired by the sanguinary subject, and the atrocious fidelity and talent
with which it is expressed, it is that the artist was a <i>woman</i>. I must
confess that Judith is not one of my favourite heroines; but I can more
easily conceive how a woman inspired by vengeance and patriotism
could execute such a deed, than that she could coolly sit down, and
day after day, hour after hour, touch after touch, dwell upon and
almost realize to the eye such an abomination as this.</p>

<p>We can study anatomy, if (like a certain princess) we have a taste
that way, in the surgeon's dissecting-room; we do not look upon pictures
to have our minds agonized and contaminated by the sight of human
turpitude and barbarity, streaming blood, quivering flesh, wounds,
tortures, death, and horrors in every shape, even though it should be
all very <i>natural</i>. Painting has been called the handmaid of nature;
is it not the duty of a handmaid to array her mistress to the best
possible advantage? At least to keep her infirmities from view and
not to expose her too undressed?</p>

<p>But I am not so weak, so cowardly, so fastidious, as to shrink from
every representation of human suffering, provided that our sympathy
be not strained beyond a certain point. To <i>please</i> is the genuine aim
of painting, as of all the fine arts; when pleasure is conveyed through
deeply excited interest, by affecting the passions, the senses, and the
imagination, painting assumes a higher character, and almost vies
with tragedy: in fact, it <i>is</i> tragedy to the eye, and is amenable to the
same laws. The St. Sebastians of Guido and Razzi; the St. Jerome
of Domenichino; the sternly beautiful Judith of Allori; the Piet&agrave; of
Raffaelle; the San Pietro Martire of Titian; are all so many tragic
<i>scenes</i> wherein whatever is revolting in circumstances or character is
judiciously kept from view, where human suffering is dignified by the
moral lesson it is made to convey, and its effect on the beholder at
once softened and heightened by the redeeming grace which genius
and poetry have shed like a glory round it.</p>

<p>Allowing all this, I am yet obliged to confess that I am wearied
with this class, of pictures, and that I wish there were fewer of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>But there is one subject which never tires, at least never tires <i>me</i>,
however varied, repeated, multiplied. A subject so lovely in itself that
the most eminent painter cannot easily embellish it, or the meanest degrade
it; a subject which comes home to our own bosoms and dearest
feelings; and in which we may "lose ourselves in all delightfulness,"
and indulge unreproved pleasure. I mean the <i>Virgin and Child</i>, or
in other words, the abstract personification of what is loveliest, purest,
and dearest, under heaven&mdash;maternal tenderness, virgin meekness,
and childish innocence, and the <i>beauty of holiness</i> over all.</p>

<p>It occurred to me to-day, that if a gallery could be formed of this
subject alone, selecting one specimen from among the works of every
painter, it would form not only a comparative index to their different
styles, but we should find, on recurring to what is known of the lives
and characters of the great masters, that each has stamped some peculiarity
of his own disposition on his Virgins; and that, after a little
consideration and practice, a very fair guess might be formed of the
character of each artist, by observing the style in which he has treated
this beautiful and favourite subject.</p>

<p>Take Raffaelle for example, whose delightful character is dwelt upon
by all his biographers; his genuine nobleness of soul, which raised him
far above interest, rivalship, or jealousy, the gentleness of his temper,
the suavity of his manners, the sweetness of his disposition, the benevolence
of his heart, which rendered him so deeply loved and admired,
even by those who pined away at his success, and died of his superiority<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>&mdash;are
all attested by contemporary writers: where but in his own
harmonious character, need Raffaelle have looked for the prototypes of
his half-celestial creations?</p>

<p>His Virgins alone combine every grace which the imagination can
require&mdash;repose, simplicity, meekness, purity, tenderness; blended
without any admixture of earthly passion, yet so varied, that though
all his Virgins have a general character, distinguishing them from those
of every other master, no two are exactly alike. In the Madonna del
Seggiola, for instance, the prevailing expression is a serious and pensive
tenderness; her eyes are turned from her infant, but she clasps him to
her bosom, as if it were not necessary to <i>see</i> him, to <i>feel</i> him in her
heart. In another Holy Family in the Pitti Palace, the predominant
expression is maternal rapture: in the Madonna di Foligno, it is a
saintly benignity becoming the Queen of Heaven: in the Madonna del
Cardellino, it is a meek and chaste simplicity: it is the "<i>Vergine dolce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
e pia</i>" of Petrarch. This last picture hangs close to the Fornarina in
the Tribune,&mdash;a strange contrast! Raffaelle's love for that haughty and
voluptuous virago, had nothing to do with his conception of ideal beauty
and chastity; and could one of his own Virgins have walked out of her
frame, or if her prototype could have been found on earth, he would
have felt, as others have felt&mdash;that to look upon such a being with
aught of unholy passion would be profanation indeed.</p>

<p>Next to Raffaelle, I would rank Correggio, as a painter of Virgins.
Correggio was remarkable for the humility and gentleness of his deportment,
for his pensive and somewhat anxious disposition, and kindly
domestic feelings: these are the characteristics which have poured
themselves forth upon his Madonnas. They are distinguished generally
by the utmost sweetness, delicacy, grace, and devotional feeling.
I remember reading somewhere that Correggio had a large family, and
was a particularly fond father; and it is certain, that in the expression
of maternal tenderness, he is superior to all but Raffaelle: his Holy
Family in the Studii at Naples, and his lovely Virgin in the gallery,
are instances.</p>

<p>Guido ranks next in my estimation, as a painter of Virgins. He is
described as an elegant and accomplished man, remarkable for the
modesty of his disposition, and the dignity and grace of his manner;
as delicate in his personal habits, and sumptuous in his dress and style
of living. He had unfortunately contracted a taste for gaming, which
latterly plunged him into difficulties, and tinged his mind with bitterness
and melancholy. All his heads have a peculiar expression of elevated
beauty, which has been called Guido's air. His Madonnas are
all but heavenly: they are tender, dignified, lovely:&mdash;but when compared
with Raffaelle's, they seem more touched with earthly feeling,
and have less of the pure ideal: they are, if I may so express myself,
too <i>sentimental</i>: sentiment is, in truth, the distinguishing characteristic
of Guido's style. It is remarkable, that towards the end of his life,
Guido more frequently painted the Mater Dolorosa, and gave to the
heads of his Madonnas a look of melancholy, disconsolate resignation,
which is extremely affecting.</p>

<p>Titian's character is well known: his ardent cheerful temper, his
sanguine enthusiastic mind, his love of pleasure, his love of women; and
true it is, that through all his glowing pictures, we trace the voluptuary.
His Virgins are rather "<i>des jeunes &eacute;pouses de la veille</i>"&mdash;far too like
his Venuses and his mistresses: they are all luxuriant <i>human</i> beauty;
with that peculiar air of blandishment which he has thrown into all his
female heads, even into his portraits, and his old women. Witness
his lovely Virgin in the Vatican, his Mater Sapienti&aelig;, and his celebrated
Assumption at Venice, in which the eyes absolutely float in
rapture. There is nothing ideal in Titian's conception of beauty: he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
paints no saints and goddesses <i>fancy-bred</i>: his females are all true,
lovely women; not like the heavenly creation of Raffaelle, looking as
if a touch, a breath would profane them; but warm flesh and blood&mdash;heart
and soul&mdash;with life in their eyes, and love upon their lips: even
over his Magdalenes, his beauty-breathing pencil has shed a something
which says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A misura che am&ograve;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piange i suoi falli!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this is straying from my subject; as I have embarked in this fanciful
hypothesis, I shall multiply my proofs and examples, as far as I can,
from memory.</p>

<p>In some account I have read of Murillo, he is emphatically styled
<i>an honest man</i>: this is all I can remember of his character; and <i>truth</i>
and nature prevail through all his pictures. In his Virgins, we can
trace nothing elevated, poetical or heavenly: they have not the <i>ideality</i>
of Raffaelle's, nor the tender sweetness of Correggio's; nor the
glowing loveliness of Titian's; but they have an individual reality
about them, which gives them the air of portraits. That chef-d'&#339;uvre,
in the Pitti Palace, for instance, call it a beautiful peasant girl and her
baby, and it is faultless: but when I am told it is the "<i>Vergine gloriosa,
del Re Eterno Madre, Figliuola, e Sposa</i>," I look instantly for
something far beyond what I see expressed. All Murillo's Virgins are
so different from each other, that it is plain the artist did not paint from
any preconceived idea of his own mind, but from different originals;
they are all impressed with that general air of truth, nature, and common
life, which stamps upon them a peculiar and distinct character.</p>

<p>Andrea del Sarto, who is in style as in character the very reverse of
Murillo, fascinated me at first by his enchanting colouring, and the
magical a&euml;rial depths of his chiaro-oscuro; but on a further acquaintance
with his works, I was struck by the predominance of external
form and colour over mind and feeling. His Virgins look as if they
had been born and bred in the first circles of society, and have a particular
air of elegance, an artificial grace, an attraction, which may be
entirely traced to exterior; to the cast of the features, the contour of
the form, the disposition of the draperies, the striking attitudes, and,
above all, the divine colouring: beauty and dignity, and powerful effect,
we always find in his pictures: but no <i>moral</i> pathos&mdash;no poetry&mdash;no
sentiment&mdash;above all, a strange and total want of devotional expression,
simplicity and humility. His Virgin with St. Francis and
St. John, which hangs behind the Venus in the Tribunes, is a wonderful
picture; and there are two charming Madonnas in the Borghese
Palace at Rome. In the first we are struck by the grouping and colouring;
in the last, by a certain graceful <i>lengthiness</i> of the limbs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
fine animated drawing in the attitudes. But we look in vain for the
"sacred and the sweet," for heart, for soul, for countenance.</p>

<p>Andrea del Sarto had, in his profession, great talents rather than
genius and enthusiasm. He was weak, dissipated, unprincipled;
without elevation of mind or generosity of temper; and that his moral
character was utterly contemptible, is proved by one trait in his life.
A generous patron who had relieved him in his necessity, afterwards
entrusted him with a considerable sum of money, to be laid out in
certain purchases; Andrea del Sarto perfidiously embezzled the whole,
and turned it to his own use. This story is told in his life, with the
addition that "he was persuaded to it by his wife, as profligate and extravagant
as himself."</p>

<p>Carlo Dolce's gentle, delicate, and melancholy temperament, are
strongly expressed in his own portrait, which is in the Gallery of Paintings
here. All his pictures are tinged by the morbid delicacy of his
constitution, and the refinement of his character and habits. They
have exquisite finish, but a want of power, degenerating at times into
coldness and feebleness; his Madonnas are distinguished by regular
feminine beauty, melancholy, devotion, or resigned sweetness: he excelled
in Mater Dolorosa. The most beautiful of his Virgins is in Pitti
Palace, of which picture there is a duplicate in the Borghese Palace
at Rome.</p>

<p>Carlo Marratti, without distinguished merit of any kind&mdash;unless it
was a distinguished merit to be the father of Faustina Zappi,&mdash;owed
his fortune, his title of <i>Cavaliere</i>, and the celebrity he once enjoyed,
not to any superiority of genius, but to his successful arts as a courtier,
and his assiduous flattery of the great. What can be more characteristic
of the man, than his simpering Virgins, fluttering in tasteless,
many-coloured draperies, with their sky blue back-grounds, and
golden clouds?</p>

<p>Caravaggio was a gloomy misanthrope and a profligate ruffian: we
read, that he was banished from Rome, for a murder committed in a
drunken brawl; and that he died at last of debauchery and want.
Caravaggio was perfect in his gamblers, robbers, and martyrdoms, and
should never have meddled with Saints and Madonnas. In his famous
<i>Piet&agrave;</i> in the Vatican, the Virgin is an old beggar-woman, the
two Maries are fish-wives, in "maudlin sorrow," and St. Peter and
St. John, a couple of bravoes, burying a murdered traveller: <i>dipinse
ferocemente sempre perche feroce era il suo carrattere</i>, says his biographer;
an observation, by the way, in support of my hypothesis.</p>

<p>Rubens, with all his transcendent genius, had a coarse imagination:
he bore the character of an honest, liberal, but not very refined man.
Rubens painted Virgins&mdash;would he had let them alone! fat, comfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
farmers' wives, nursing their chubby children. Then follows
Vandyke in the opposite extreme. Vandyke was celebrated in his
day, for his personal accomplishments: he was, says his biographers,
a complete scholar, courtier and gentleman. His beautiful Madonnas
are, accordingly, what we might expect&mdash;rather too intellectual and
lady-like: they all look as if they had been polished by education.</p>

<p>The grand austere genius of Michel Angelo was little calculated to
portray the dove-like meekness of the <i>Vergine dolce e pia</i>, or the playfulness
of infantine beauty. In his Mater Amabilis, sweetness and
beauty are sacrificed to expression; and dignity is exaggerated into
masculine energy. In the Mater Dolorosa, suffering is tormented
into agony: the anguish is too human: it is not sufficiently softened
by resignation; and makes us turn away with a too painful sympathy.
Such is the admirable head in the Palazzo Litti at Milan; such his sublime
<i>Piet&agrave;</i> in the Vatican&mdash;but the last, being in marble, is not quite
a case in point.</p>

<p>I will mention but two more painters of whose lives and characters
I know nothing yet, and may therefore fairly make their works a test
of both, and judge of them in their Madonnas, and afterwards measure
my own penetration and the truth of my hypothesis, by a reference
to the biographical writers.</p>

<p>In the few pictures I have seen of Carlo Cignani, I have been struck
by the predominance of mind and feeling over mere external form:
there is a picture of his in the Rospigliosi Palace&mdash;or rather, to give an
example which is nearer at hand, and fresh in my memory, there is
in the gallery <i>here</i>, his Madonna del Rosario. It represents a beautiful
young woman, evidently of plebeian race: the form of the face is
round, the features have nothing of the beau-ideal, and the whole head
wants dignity: yet has the painter contrived to throw into this lovely
picture an inimitable expression which depends on nothing external,
which in the living prototype we should term <i>countenance</i>; as if a
chastened consciousness of her high destiny and exalted character
shone through the natural rusticity of her features, and touched them
with a certain grace and dignity, emanating from the mind alone,
which only mind could give, and mind perceive. I have seen within
the last few days, three copies of this picture, in all of them the charming
simplicity and rusticity, but in none the exquisite expression of
the original: even the hands are expressive, without any particular
delicacy or beauty of form. An artist who was copying the picture
to-day while I looked at it, remarked this; and confessed he had made
several unsuccessful attempts to render the fond pressure of the fingers
as she clasps the child to her bosom.</p>

<p>Were I to judge of Carlo Cignani by his works, I should pronounce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
him a man of elevated character, noble by instinct, if not by descent,
but simple in his habits, and a despiser of outward show and
ostentation.</p>

<p>The other painter I alluded to, is Sasso Ferrato, a great and admired
manufacturer of Virgins, but a mere copyist, without pathos, power, or
originality; sometimes he resembles Guido, sometimes Carlo Dolce;
but the graceful harmonious delicacy of the former becomes coldness
and flatness in his hands, and the refinement and sweetness of the
latter sink into feebleness and insipidity. Were I to judge of his
character by his Madonnas, I should suppose that Sasso Ferrato had
neither original genius nor powerful intellect, nor warmth of heart, nor
vivacity of temper; that he was, in short, a mere mild, inoffensive,
good sort of man, studious and industrious in his art, not without a
feeling for the excellence he wanted power to attain.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>I might pursue this subject further, but my memory fails, my head
aches, and my pen is tired for to-night.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Both here and at Rome, I have found considerable amusement in
looking over the artists who are usually employed in copying or studying
from the celebrated pictures in the different galleries; but I have
been taught discretion on such occasions by a ridiculous incident which
occurred the other day, as absurdly comic as it was unlucky and vexatious.
A friend of mine observing an artist at work in the Pitti
palace, whom, by his total silence and inattention to all around, she
supposed to be a native Italian who did not understand a word of
English, went up to him, and peeping over his shoulder, exclaimed
with more truth than discretion, "Ah! what a hideous attempt! that
will never be like, I'm sure!" "I am very sorry you think so,
ma'am," replied the painter, coolly looking up in her face. He must
have read in that beautiful face an expression which deeply avenged
the cause of his affronted picture.</p>

<p>We have been twice to the opera since we arrived here. At the
Pergola, Bassi, though a woman, is the <i>Primo Uomo</i>; the rare quality
of her voice, which is a kind of rich deep counter-tenor, unfitting
her for female parts. Her voice and science are so admirable, that it
would be delicious to hear her blindfold; but her large clumsy figure
disguised, or rather <i>exposed</i>, in masculine attire, is quite revolting.</p>

<p>At the Cocomero we had the "Italiana in Algieri:" the Prima
Donna, who is an admired singer, gave the comic airs with great power
and effect, but her bold execution and her ungraceful unliquid voice
disgusted me, and I came away fatigued and dissatisfied. The dancing
is execrable at both theatres.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>From one end of Italy to the other, nothing is listened to in the way
of music but Rossini and his imitators. The man must have a transcendant
genius, who can lead and pervert the taste of his age as Rossini
has done; but unfortunately those who have not his talent, who
cannot reach his beauties nor emulate his airy brilliance of imagination,
think to imitate his ornamented style by merely crowding note upon
note, semi-quavers, demi-semi-quavers, and semi-demi-semi-quavers
in most perplexed succession; and thus all Italy, and thence all Europe,
is deluged with this busy, fussy, hurry-skurry music, which means
nothing, and leaves no trace behind it either on the fancy or the memory.
Must it be ever thus? are Paesiello, and Pergolesi, and Cimarosa&mdash;and
those divine German masters, who formed themselves on the
Italian school and surpassed it&mdash;Winter and Mozart<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> and Gluck&mdash;are
they eternally banished? must sense and feeling be for ever sacrificed
to mere sound, the human organ degraded into a mere instrument,<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a>
and the ear tickled with novelty and meretricious ornament, till the
taste is utterly diseased?</p>

<p>There was a period in the history of Italian literature, when the
great classical writers were decried and neglected, and the genius of
one man depraved the taste of the age in which he lived. Marini introduced,
or at least rendered general and fashionable, that far-fetched
wit, that tinsel and glittering style, that luxurious pomp of words,
which was easily imitated by talents of a lower order: yet in the
Adonis there are many redeeming passages, some touches of real
pathos, and some stanzas of natural and beautiful description: and thus
it is with Rossini; his best operas contain some melodies among the
finest ever composed, and even in his worst, the ear is every now and
then roused and enchanted by a few bars of graceful and beautiful
melody, to be in the next moment again bewildered in the maze of
unmeaning notes, and the clash of overpowering accompaniments.</p>

<p><i>Lucca, April 23.</i>&mdash;Lucca disappoints me in every respect: it was
once, when a republic, one of the most flourishing, rich, and populous
cities in Italy; it is now consigned over to the Ex-queen of Etruria;
and its fate will be perhaps the same as that of Venice, Pisa, and Sienna,
which, when they lost their independence, lost also their public spirit,
their public virtue, and their prosperity.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive any thing more rich and beautiful, than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the country between Florence and Lucca, though it can boast little of
the elevated picturesque, and is destitute of poetical associations. The
road lay through valleys, with the Apennines (which are here softened
down into gently sunny hills) on each side. Every spot of ground is
in the highest state of cultivation; the boundaries between the small
fields of wheat or lupines, were rows of olives or mulberries, with an
interminable treillage of vines flung from tree to tree. In England we
should be obliged to cut them all down for fear of depriving the crops
of heat and sunshine, but here they have no such fears. The style of
husbandry is exquisitely neat, and in general performed by manual
labour. The only plough I saw would have excited the amusement
and amazement of an English farmer: I should think it was exactly
similar to the ploughs of Virgil's time: it was drawn by an ox and an
ass yoked together, and guided by a woman. The whole country
looked as if it had been laid out by skilful gardeners, and the hills in
many parts were cut into terraces, that not one available inch of soil
might be lost. The products of this luxuriant country are corn, silk,
wine, and principally oil: potteries abound, the making of jars and
flasks being an immense and necessary branch of trade.</p>

<p>The city of Lucca has an appearance in itself of stately solemn dulness,
and bears no trace of the smiling prosperity of the adjacent country:
the shops are poor and empty, there are no signs of business, and
the streets swarm with beggars. The interior of the Duomo is a fine
specimen of Gothic: the exterior is Greek, Gothic, and Saracenic
jumbled together in vile taste: it contains nothing very interesting.
The palace is like other palaces, very fine and so forth; and only remarkable
for not containing one good picture, or one valuable work of
art.</p>

<p><i>Pisa, April 25.</i>&mdash;Pisa has a look of elegant tranquillity, which is
not exactly <i>dulness</i>, and pleases me particularly: if the thought of its
past independence, the memory of its once proud name in arts, arms,
and literature, came across the mind, it is not accompanied by any
painful regret caused by the sight of present misery and degradation,
but by that philosophic melancholy with which we are used to contemplate
the mutability of earthly greatness.</p>

<p>The Duomo, the Baptistry, the Leaning Tower, and the Campo
Santo, stand altogether in a fine open elevated part of the city. The
Duomo is a magnificent edifice in bad taste. The interior, with its
noble columns of oriental granite, is grand, sombre, and very striking.
As to the style of architecture, it would be difficult to determine what
name to give it: it is not Greek, nor Gothic, nor Saxon, and exhibits a
strange mixture of Pagan and Christian ornaments, not very unfrequent
in Italian churches. The Leaning Tower should be contemplated
from the portico of the church to heighten its effect: when the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>perpendicular
column cuts it to the eye like a plumb line, the obliquity
appears really terrific.</p>

<p>The Campo Santo is an extraordinary place: <a name="it152" id="it152"></a>it affects the mind like
the cloisters of one of our Gothic cathedrals which it resembles in
effect. Means have lately been taken to preserve the singular frescos
on the walls, which for five hundred years have been exposed to the
open air.</p>

<p>I remarked the tomb of that elegant fabulist Pignotti; the last
personage of celebrity buried in the Campo Santo.</p>

<p>The university of Pisa is no longer what it was when France and
Venice had nearly gone to war about one of its law professors, and its
colleges ranked next to those of Padua: it has declined in fame, in
riches, and in discipline. The Botanic Garden was a few years ago
the finest in all Europe, and is still maintained with great cost and
care: it contains a lofty magnolia, the stem of which is as bulky as a
good sized tree: the gardener told us rather poetically, that when in
blossom it perfumed the whole city of Pisa.</p>

<p><i>Leghorn, April 26.</i>&mdash;So different from any thing we have yet seen
in Italy! busy streets&mdash;gay shops&mdash;various costumes&mdash;Greeks, Turks,
Jews, and Christians, mingled on terms of friendly equality&mdash;a
crowded port, and all the activity of prosperous commerce.</p>

<p>Leghorn is in every sense a <i>free</i> port: all kinds of merchandise enter
exempt from duty, all religions are equally tolerated, and all nations
trade on an equal footing.</p>

<p>The Jews, who are in every other city a shunned and degraded
race, are among the most opulent and respectable inhabitants of
Leghorn: their quarter is the richest, and, I may add, the <i>dirtiest</i> in
the city: their synagogue here is reckoned the finest in Europe, and
I was induced to visit it yesterday at the hour of worship. I confess
I was much disappointed; and, notwithstanding my inclination to
respect always what is respectable in the eyes of others, I never felt so
strong a disposition to smile. An old Rabbi with a beard of venerable
length, a pointed bonnet, and a long white veil, got up into a superb
marble pulpit and chanted in strange nasal tones, something which
was repeated after him in various and discordant voices by the rest of
the assembly. The congregation consisted of an uncouth set of men
and boys, many of them from different parts of the Levant, in the
dresses of their respective countries: there was no appearance of devotion,
no solemnity; all wore their hats, some were poring over ragged
books, some were talking, some sleeping, or lounging, or smoking.
While I stood looking about me, without exciting the smallest attention,
I heard at every pause a prodigious chattering and whispering,
which seemed to come from the regions above, and looking up I saw a
row of latticed and skreened galleries where the women were caged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
up like the monkies at a menagerie, and seemed as noisy, as restless,
and as impatient of confinement: the door-keeper offered to introduce
me among them, but I was already tired and glad to depart.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>We have visited the pretty English burial-ground, and the tomb of
Smollet, which in the true English style is cut and scratched all over
with the names of fools, who think thus to link their own insignificance
to his immortality. We have also seen whatever else is to be seen, and
what all travellers describe: to-morrow we leave Leghorn&mdash;for myself
without regret: it is a place with which I have no sympathies, and
the hot, languid, damp atmosphere, which depresses the spirits and
relaxes the nerves, has made me suffer ever since we arrived.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Lucca.</i>&mdash;Had I never visited Italy I think I should never have understood
the word <i>picturesque</i>. In England we apply it generally to
rural objects or natural scenery, for nothing else in England <i>can</i> deserve
the epithet. Civilization, cleanliness, and comfort are excellent things,
but they are sworn enemies to the picturesque: they have banished it
gradually from our towns, and habitations, into remote countries, and
little nooks and corners, where we are obliged to hunt after it to find
it; but in Italy the picturesque is every where, in every variety of
form; it meets us at every turn, in town and in country, at all times
and seasons; the commonest objects of every-day life here become
picturesque, and assume from a thousand causes a certain character of
poetical interest it cannot have elsewhere. In England, when travelling
in some distant county, we see perhaps a craggy hill, a thatched
cottage, a mill on a winding stream, a rosy milkmaid, or a smock-frocked
labourer whistling after his plough, and we exclaim "How
picturesque!" Travelling in Italy we see a piny mountain, a little
dilapidated village on its declivity, the ruined temple of Jupiter or
Apollo on its summit; a peasant with a bunch of roses hanging from
his hat, and singing to his guitar, or a cotadina in her white veil and
scarlet petticoat, and we exclaim "How picturesque!" but how different!
Again&mdash;a tidy drill or a hay-cart, with a team of fine horses,
is a very useful, valuable, civilized machine; but a grape-waggon
reeling under its load of purple clusters, and drawn by a pair of oxen
in their clumsy, ill-contrived harness, and bowing their patient heads
to the earth, is much more picturesque. A spinning wheel is very
convenient it must be allowed, but the distaff and spindle are much
more picturesque. A snug English villa with its shaven lawn, its
neat shrubbery, and its park, is a delightful thing&mdash;an Italian villa is
probably far less <i>comfortable</i>, but with its vineyards, its gardens, its
fountains, and statutes, is far more picturesque. A laundry-maid at
her wash-tub, immersed in soap-suds, is a vulgar idea, though our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
clothes may be the better for it. I shall never forget the group of
women I saw at Terracina washing their linen in a bubbling brook as
clear as crystal, which rushed from the mountains to the sea&mdash;there
were twenty of them at least grouped with the most graceful effect,
some standing up to the mid-leg in the stream, others spreading the
linen on the sunny bank, some, flinging back their long hair, stood
shading their brows with their hands and gazing on us as we passed: it
was a <i>scene</i> for a poet, or a painter, or a melo-drama. An English
garden, adorned at every turn with statues of the heathen deities (although
they were all but personifications of the various attributes of
nature,) would be ridiculous. Setting aside the injury they must sustain
from our damp, variable climate, they would be <i>out of keeping</i>
with all around; here it is altogether different; the very air of Italy is
embued with the spirit of ancient mythology; and though "the fair
humanities of old religion," the Nymphs, the Fauns, the Dryads be
banished from their haunts and live no longer in the faith of reason,
yet still, whithersoever we turn, some statue, some temple in ruins,
some fragment of an altar, some inscription half effaced, some name
half-barbarized, recalls to the fancy those forms of light, of beauty, of
majesty, which poetry created to people scenes for which mere humanity
was not in itself half pure enough, fair enough, bright enough.</p>

<p>What can be more grand than a noble forest of English oak? or
more beautiful than a grove of beeches and elms, clothed in their rich
autumnal tints? or more delicious than the apple orchard in full
bloom? but it is true, notwithstanding, that the olive, and cypress, and
cedar, the orange and the citron, the fig and the pomegranate, the myrtle
and the vine, convey a different and more luxuriant feeling to the
mind; and are associated with ideas which give to the landscape they
adorn a character more delightfully, more <i>poetically</i> picturesque.</p>

<p>When at Lord Grosvenor's or Lord Stafford's I have been seated
opposite to some beautiful Italian landscape, a Claude or a Poussin, with
a hill crowned with olives, a ruined temple, a group of peasants seated
on a fallen column, or dancing to the pipe and the guitar, and over all
the crimson glow of evening, or the violet tints of morning, I have exclaimed
with others, "How lovely! how picturesque, how very
poetical!" No one thought of saying "How <i>natural</i>!" because it is a
style of nature with which we are totally unacquainted; and if some
amateurs of real taste and feeling prefer a rural cattle scene of Paul
Potter or Cuyp, to all the grand or lovely creations of Salvator, or
Claude, or Poussin, it is perhaps, because the former are associated in
their minds with reality and familiar nature, while the latter appear in
comparison mere inventions of the painter's fertile fancy, mere visionary
representations of what may or might exist but which do not come
home to the memory or the mind with the force of truth or delighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
recollection. So when I have been travelling in Italy how often I have
exclaimed, "How like a picture!" and I remember once, while contemplating
a most glorious sunset from the banks of the Arno, I caught
myself saying, "This is truly one of Claude's sunsets!" Now should
I live to see again one of my favourite Grosvenor Claudes I shall probably
exclaim, "How natural! how like what I have seen so often
on the Arno, or from the Monte Pincio!"</p>

<p>And, in conclusion, let it be remembered by those who are inclined
to smile (as I have often done) when travellers fresh from Italy <i>rave</i>
almost in blank verse, and think it all as unmeaning as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lutes, laurels, seas of milk, and ships of amber!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>let them recollect that it is not alone the <i>visible</i> picturesque of Italy
which thus intoxicates; it is not only her fervid skies, her sunsets,
which envelope one-half of heaven from the horizon to the zenith, in
living blaze; nor her soaring pine-clad mountains; nor her azure
seas; nor her fields, "ploughed by the <a name="sunbeams" id="sunbeams"></a>sunbeams;" nor her gorgeous
cities, spread out with all their domes and towers, unobscured by
cloud or vapours;&mdash;but it is something more than these, something
beyond, and over all&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;The gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light that never was on sea or land<br /></span>

<p><i>Genoa, 30.</i>&mdash;We arrived here late, and I should not write now,
weary, weak, sick, and down-spirited as I am, did I not know how
the impressions of one day efface those of the former; and as I cannot
sleep, it is better to scribble than to think.</p>

<p>As to describing all I have seen, thought, and felt in three days,
that were indeed impossible: I think I have exhausted all my prose
eloquence, and all allowable raptures; so that unless I ramble into absolute
poetry, I dare not say a word of the scenery around Sarzana
and Lerici. After spending one evening at Sarzana, in lingering through
green lanes and watching the millions of fire-flies, sparkling in the dark
shade of the trees, and lost again in the brilliant moonlight&mdash;we left it
the next morning about sunrise, to embark in a felucca at Lerici, as
the road between Spezia and Sestri is not yet completed. The groves
and vineyards on each side of the road were filled with nightingales,
singing in concert loud enough to overpower the sound of our carriage-wheels,
and the whole scene, as the sun rose over it, and the purple
shadows drew off and disclosed it gradually to the eye, was so enchanting&mdash;that
positively I will say nothing about it.</p>

<p>Lerici is a small fishing town on the Gulf of Spezia. Here I met
with an adventure which with a little exaggeration and embellishment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
such as no real story-teller ever spares, would make an admirable
morceau for a quarto tourist; but, in simple truth, was briefly thus.</p>

<p>While some of our party were at breakfast, and the servants and
sailors were embarking the carriages and baggage, I sat down to sketch
the old grey fort on the cliff above the town; but every time I looked
up, the scene was so inexpressibly gay and lovely, it was with difficulty
and reluctance I could turn my eyes down to my paper again;
and soon I gave up the attempt, and threw away both paper and pencil.
It struck me that the view <i>from</i> the castle itself must be a thousand
times finer than the view of the castle from below, and without loss of
time I proceeded to explore the path leading to it. With some fatigue
and difficulty, and after losing myself once or twice, I reached the top
of the rock, and there a wicket opened into a walled passage cut into
steps to ease the ascent. I knocked at the wicket with three strokes,
that being the orthodox style of demanding entrance into the court
of an enchanted castle, using my parasol instead of a dagger,<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a>
and no one appearing, I entered, and in a few moments reached
a small paved terrace in front of the fortress, defended towards
the sea by a low parapet wall. The massy portal was closed, and
instead of a bugle horn hanging at the gate I found only the handle and
fragments of an old birch-broom, which base utensil I presently applied
to the purpose of a horn, viz. sounding an alarm, and knocked and
knocked&mdash;but no hoary-headed seneschal nor armed warder appeared
at my summons. After a moment's hesitation, I gave the door a push
with all my strength: it yielded, creaking on its hinges, and I stepped
over the raised threshold. I found myself in a low dark vaulted hall
which appeared at first to have no communication with any other
chamber: but on advancing cautiously to the end I found a low door
in the side, which had once been defended by a strong iron grating of
which some part remained: it led to a flight of stone stairs, which I
began to ascend slowly, stopping every moment to listen; but all was
still as the grave. On each side of this winding staircase I peeped into
several chambers, all solitary and ruinous: more and more surprised,
I continued to ascend till I put my head unexpectedly through a trap-door,
and found myself on the roof on the tower: it was spacious,
defended by battlements, and contained the only signs of warlike preparation
I had met with; <i>videlicet</i>, two cannons, or culverins, as they
are called, and a pyramidal heap of balls, rusted by the sea air.</p>

<p>I sat down on one of the cannon, and leaning on the battlements,
surveyed the scene around, below me, with a feeling of rapture, not
a little enhanced by the novelty and romance of my situation. I was
alone&mdash;I had no reason to think there was a single human being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
within hearing. I was at such a vast height above the town and the
shore, that not a sound reached me, except an indistinct murmur now
and then, borne upwards by the breeze, and the scream of the sea-fowl
as they wheeled round and round my head. I looked down giddily
upon the blue sea, all glowing and trembling in the sunshine: and the
scenery around me was such, as the dullest eye&mdash;the coldest, the most
<i>unimaginative</i> soul, could not have contemplated without emotion. I
sat, I know not how long, abandoned to reveries, sweet and bitter, till
I was startled by footsteps close to me, and turning round, I beheld a
figure so strange and fantastic, and considering the time, place, and
circumstance, so incomprehensible and extraordinary, that I was dumb
with surprise. It was a little spare old man, with a face and form
which resembled the anatomy of a baboon, dressed in an ample nightgown
of flowered silk, which hung upon him as if it had been made
for a giant, and trailed on the ground, a yard and a half behind him.
He had no stockings, but on his feet a pair of red slippers, turned up in
front like those the Turks wear. His beard was grizzled, and on his
head he wore one of the long many-coloured woollen caps usually worn
in this country, with two tassels depending from it, which nearly
reached his knees. I had full time to examine the appearance and
costume of this strange apparition as he stood before me, bowing profoundly,
and looking as if fright and wonder had deprived him of
speech. As soon as I had recovered from my first amazement, I replied
to every low bow, by as low a courtesy, and waited till it should
please him to begin the parley.</p>

<p>At length he ventured to ask, in bad provincial Italian, what I did there?</p>

<p>I replied that I was only admiring the fine prospect.</p>

<p>He begged to know, "<i>come diavolo</i>," I had got there?</p>

<p>I assured him I had not got there by any <i>diabolical</i> aid, but had
merely walked through the door.</p>

<p><i>Santi Apostoli!</i> did not my excellency know, that, according to
the laws and regulations of war, no one could enter the fort, without
permission first obtained of the governor?</p>

<p>I apologized politely: "And where," said I, "is the governor?"</p>

<p><i>Il Governatore son io per servirla!</i> he replied, with a low bow.</p>

<p>You! <i>O che bel ceffo!</i> thought I&mdash;"and what, Signor Governor,
is the use of your fort?"</p>

<p>"To defend the bay and town of Lerici from enemies and pirates."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "I see no soldier; where is the garrison to defend
the fort?"</p>

<p><a name="The157" id="The157"></a>The little old man stepped back two steps&mdash;"<i>Eccomi!</i>" he replied,
spreading his hand on his breast, and bowing with dignity.</p>

<p>It was impossible to make any reply: I therefore wished the governor
and garrison good morning; and disappearing through my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
trap-door, I soon made my way down to the shore, where I arrived out
of breath, and just in time to step into our felucca.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>If there be a time when we most wish for those of whom we always
think, when we most love those who are always dearest, it must be
on such a delicious night as that we passed at Sarzana, or on such a
morning as that we spent at Lerici; and if there be a time when we
least love those we always love&mdash;least wish for them, least think of
them, it must be in such a moment as the noontide of yesterday&mdash;when
the dead calm overtook us, half way between Lerici and Sestri,
and I sat in the stern of our felucca, looking with a sort of despairing
languor over the smooth purple sea, which scarcely heaved round us,
while the flapping sails drooped useless round the masts, and the
rowers indolently leaning on their oars, sung in a low and plaintive
chorus. I sat hour after hour, still and silent, sickening in the sunshine,
dazzled by its reflection on the water, and overcome with deadly
nausea: I believe nothing on earth could have roused me at that moment.
But evening so impatiently invoked, came at last: the sun set,
the last gleam of his "golden path of rays" faded from the waters,
the sea assumed the hue of ink; the breeze sprung up, and our little
vessel, with all its white sails spread, glanced like a white swan over
the waves, leaving behind "a moon-illumined wake." Two hours
after dark we reached Sestri, where we found miserable accommodations;
and after foraging in vain for something to eat, after our
day's fast, we crept to bed, all sick, sleepy, hungry, and tired.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>We leave Genoa to-morrow: I can say but little of it, for I have
been ill, as usual, almost ever since we arrived; and though my little
Diary has become to me a species of hobby, I have lately found it
fatiguing, even to write! and the pleasure and interest it used to afford
me, diminish daily.</p>

<p>Genoa, though fallen, is still "Genoa the proud." She is like a
noble matron, blooming in years, and dignified in decay; while her
rival Venice always used to remind me of a beautiful courtezan repenting
in sackcloth and ashes, and mingling the ragged remnants of her
former splendour with the emblems of present misery, degradation,
and mourning. Pursue the train of similitude, Florence may be
likened to a blooming bride dressed out to meet her lover; Naples to
Tasso's Armida, with all the allurements of the Syren, and all the
terrors of the Sorceress; Rome sits crowned upon the grave of her
power, widowed indeed, and desolate, but still, like the queenly Constance,
she maintains the majesty of Sorrow&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is my throne, let kings come bow to it!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>The coup-d'&#339;il of Genoa, splendid as it is, is not equal to that of
Naples, even setting poetical associations aside: it is built like a
crescent round the harbour, rising abruptly from the margin of the
water, which makes the view from the sea so beautiful: to the north
the hills enclose it round like an amphitheatre. The adjacent country
is covered with villas, gardens, vineyards, woods, and olive-groves
forming a scene most enchanting to the eye and mind, though of a
character very different from the savage luxuriance of the south of
Italy.</p>

<p>The view of the city from any of the heights around, more particularly
from that part of the shore called the Ponente, where we were
to-day, is grand beyond description; on every side the church of
Carignano is a beautiful and striking object.</p>

<p>There is but one street, properly so called, in Genoa&mdash;the Strada
Nuova; the others are little paved alleys, most of them impassable to
carriages, both from their narrowness and the irregularity of the
ground on which the city is built.</p>

<p>The Strada Nuova is formed of a double line of magnificent palaces,
among which the Doria Palace is conspicuous. The architecture is in
general fine; and when not good is at least pleasing; the fronts of
the houses are in general gaily painted and stuccoed. The best apartments
are usually at the top; and the roofs often laid out in terraces,
or paved with marble and adorned with flowers and shrubs.</p>

<p>I have seen few good pictures here: the best collections are those
in the Brignolet and Durazzo palaces. In the latter are some striking
pictures by Spagnoletto (or Ribera, as he is called here). In the
Brignolet, the Roman Daughter, by Guido, struck me most. I was
also pleased by some fine pictures of the Genoese painter Piola, who
is little known beyond Genoa.</p>

<p>The church of the Carignano, which is a miniature model of St.
Peter's, contains Paget's admirable statue of St. Sebastian, which
Napoleon intended to have conveyed to Paris.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>Beauty is no rarity at Genoa: I think I never saw so many fine
women in one place, though I have seen finer faces at Rome and
Naples than any I see here. The mezzaro, a veil or shawl thrown
over the head and round the shoulders, is universal, and is certainly
the most natural and becoming dress which can be worn by our sex:
the materials differ in fineness, from the most exquisite lace and the
most expensive embroidery, to a piece of chintz or linen, but the effect
is the same. This costume, which prevails more or less through all
Italy, but here is general, gives something of beauty to the plainest face,
and something of elegance to the most vulgar figure; it can make <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>deformity
itself look passable: and when worn by a really graceful and
beautiful female, the effect is peculiarly picturesque and bewitching.</p>

<p>It was a Festa to-day; and we drove slowly along the Ponente
after dinner. Nothing could be more gay than the streets and public
walks, crowded with holiday people: the women were in proportion
as six to one; and looked like groups dressed to figure in a melodrame
or ballet.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>When once we have left Genoa behind us, and have taken our last
look of the blue Mediterranean, I shall indeed feel that we have quitted
Italy. Piedmont is not Italy. Cities which are only famous for their
sieges and fortifications, plains only celebrated as fields of battle and
scenes of blood, have neither charms nor interest for me.</p>

<p>On Monday we set off for Turin: how I dread travelling! and the
motion of the carriage, which has now become <i>so</i> painful! Yet a little,
a very little longer, and it will all be over.</p>

<p><i>Turin, May 10th.</i>&mdash;We arrived here yesterday, after a journey to
me most trying and painful: I thought at Novi and afterwards at Asti,
that I should have been obliged to give up and confess my inability to
proceed; but we know not what we can bear till we prove ourselves;
I can live and suffer still.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>I agree with &mdash;&mdash; who has just left me, that nothing can be more
animating and improving than the conversation of intelligent and clever
men, and that lady-society is in general very <i>fade</i> and tiresome: and
yet I truly believe that no woman can devote herself exclusively to the
society of men without losing some of the best and sweetest characteristics
of her sex. The conversation of men of the world and men of
gallantry, gives insensibly a taint to the mind; the unceasing language
of adulation and admiration intoxicates the head and perverts the heart;
the habit of <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>, the habit of being always either the sole or the
principal object of attention, of mingling in no conversation which is
not personal, narrows the disposition, weakens the mind, and renders
it incapable of rising to general views or principles; while it so excites
the senses and the imagination, that every thing else becomes in comparison
stale, flat, and unprofitable. The life of a coquette is very like
that of a drunkard or an opium eater, and its end is the same&mdash;the
utter extinction of intellect, of cheerfulness, of generous feeling, and of
self-respect.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>St. Michel, Monday.</i>&mdash;I know not why I open my book, or why I
should keep accounts of times and places. I saw nothing of Turin but
what I beheld from my window: and as soon as I could travel we set
off, crossed Mount Cenis in a storm, slept at Lans-le-bourg, and reached
this place yesterday, where I am again ill, and worse&mdash;worse than
ever.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that while life is thus rapidly wasting, I should still
be so strong to suffer? the pang, the agony is not less acute at this moment,
than when, fifteen months ago, the poignard was driven to my
heart. The cup, though I have nearly drained it to the last, is not less
bitter now than when first presented to my lips. But this is not well;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
why indeed should I repine? mine was but a common fate&mdash;like a true
woman, I did but stake my all of happiness upon one cast&mdash;and lost!</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>Lyons, 19th.</i>&mdash;Good God! for what purpose do we feel! why within
our limited sphere of action, our short and imperfect existence have we
such boundless capacity for enjoying and suffering? no doubt for some
good purpose. But I cannot think as I used to think: my ideas are perplexed:
it is all pain of heart and confusion of mind; a sense of bitterness,
and wrong, and sorrow, which I cannot express, nor yet quite <i>suppress</i>.
If the cloud would but clear away that I might feel and see to do what
is right! but all is dark, and heavy, and vacant; my mind is dull,
and my eyes are dim, and I am scarce conscious of any thing around
me.</p>

<p>A few days passed here in quiet, and kind Dr. P** have revived me
a little.</p>

<p>All the way from Turin I have slept almost constantly, if that can
be called <i>sleep</i>, which was rather the stupor of exhaustion, and left me
still sensible of what was passing round me. I heard voices, though I
knew not what they said; and I felt myself moved from place to place
though I neither knew nor cared whither.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>All that I have seen and heard, all that I have felt and suffered,
since I left Italy, recalls to my mind that delightful country. I should
regret what I have left behind, had I not outlived all regrets&mdash;but one&mdash;for
there, though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I vainly sought from outward forms to win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passion and the life whose fountains are within;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>all feeling was not yet worn out of my heart: I was not then blinded
nor stupified by sorrow and weakness as I have been since.</p>

<p>There are some places we remember with pleasure, because we
have been happy there; others, because endeared to us as the residence
of friends. We love our country because it is <i>our country</i>; our home
because it is <i>home</i>: London or Paris we may prefer, as comprehending
in themselves, all the intellectual pleasures, and luxuries of life: but,
dear Italy!&mdash;we love it, simply for its own sake: not as in general we
are attached to places and things, but as we love a friend, and the face
of a friend; there it was "<i>luxury to be</i>,"&mdash;there I would willingly
have died, if so it might have pleased God.</p>

<p>Till this evening we have not seen a gleam of sunshine, nor a glimpse
of the blue sky, since we crossed Mount Cenis. We entered Lyons
during a small drizzling rain. The dirty streets, the black gloomy-looking
house, the smoking manufactories, and busy looks of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
people, made me think of Florence and Genoa, and their "fair white
walls" and princely domes; and when in the evening I heard the whining
organ which some wretched Savoyard was grinding near us, I remembered
even with emotion the delightful voices I heard singing "<i>Di
piacer mi balza il cor</i>" under my balcony at Turin&mdash;my last recollection
of Italy: and to-night, when they opened the window to give me
air, I felt, on recovering, the cold chill of the night breeze; and as I
shivered, and shrunk away from it, I remembered the delicious and
genial softness of our Italian evenings&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p><i>22.</i>&mdash;No letters from England.</p>

<p>Now that it is past, I may confess, that till now, a faint&mdash;a very faint
hope did cling to my heart. I thought it might have been just possible;
but it is over now&mdash;<i>all</i> is over!</p>

<p>We leave Lyons on Tuesday, and travel by short easy stages; and
they think I may still reach Paris. I will hold up&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>Yet if they would but lay me down on the road-side, and leave me to
die in quietness! to rest is all I ask.</p>

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
